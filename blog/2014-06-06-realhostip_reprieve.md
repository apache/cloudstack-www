<p>As mentioned previously, the <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/realhostip_service_is_being_retired">realhostip.com dynamic DNS resolver service is being retired this summer</a>. During testing of Apache CloudStack version 4.3, we found a few more issues related to realhostip.com that have been addressed for the 4.4 release.
</p>
<p>In order to give everybody a reasonable window to update their CloudStack installations to use the updated code, the retirement date for the realhostip.com service has been pushed back to <b>September 30th, 2014</b>. This provides an additional 3 months from the original June 30th date.
</p>
