<p>With two very successful events in the United Stated we know it is time to bring this conference to Europe. This time we’re gathering the community in The Netherlands. More specific, right in the center of Amsterdam in one of its historical landmarks, the Beurs van Berlage.</p>

<p>Starting November 20th with a hack day and continuing with a two day conference, this will be your opportunity to dive into all things CloudStack. Meet the community, discuss new ideas and learn about existing and upcoming features. We have setup the conference to provide an exciting environment to participate in workshops, attend presentations or just sit back and have a drink with other CloudStack enthusiasts. </p>

<p>The Call for Papers is open right now, so send your abstract to <a href="mailto:cfp@cloudstackcollab.org">cfp@cloudstackcollab.org</a>. If it’s relevant to Apache CloudStack development, deployment, and integration, we’re interested in what you might have to say. We can accommodate workshops, hack sessions, presentation and we want to work with you to make sure you can share what you want with the community.
