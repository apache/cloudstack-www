CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2022 took place on 14th-16th November. The event, which is organised by a team of volunteers from the Apache CloudStack Community, was held in the Capital Fort Business centre in Sofia, Bulgaria.

For the first time, the CloudStack Collaboration Conference was held as a hybrid event. It was streamed live on Hubilo for those who were not able to attend in-person. As it was the first time the community had collaborated in-person since the pandemic, we managed to collect a record number of physical attendees!

The conference hosted over 370 participants and 48 speakers from 32 countries. In total, there were 38 sessions from leading CloudStack experts, users and skilful engineers from the open-source world. These sessions included: technical talks, user stories, new features and integrations presentations and more.

<div>Edge computing has been gaining popularity as it defines a model that brings compute and storage closer to where they are consumed by the end-user. By being closer to the end-user a better experience can be provided with a reduction in overall latency, lower bandwidth requirements, lower TCO, more flexible hardware/software model, while also ensuring security and reliability. In this talk, Abhishek discusses aligning Apache CloudStack with this evolving cloud computing model and supporting Edge Zones, which can be also looked upon as lightweight zones, with minimal resources.</div>

This talk is for ISPs looking to bill CloudStack resources, and for software developers looking to build a billing solution around CloudStack. This talk looks at covering multiple business and technical use cases (for example: plans, catalogues, flexible billing, tiered offerings, account management, etc.) for running a public cloud and how the same can be achieved using CloudStack. It does not delve into any specific billing system but instead focuses on an open approach to how ACS features can be leveraged to implement billing and monetise CloudStack.

The Kubernetes Cluster API (CAPI) sub-project aims to simplify and unify the Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management. With almost a dozen provider implementations, we decided to add our own provider implementation for Apache CloudStack. But how simple was it? With several CRDs, controllers, API versions, and even experimental features, and e2e tests to develop, it’s easy to get lost in the details and can seem quite overwhelming. Join us to discover how we did it! We detail our journey, from building an initial prototype over a weekend to a full-fledged, production-ready application, and deployed in an environment with over 10s of 1000s of hosts! We share the pitfalls, hacks, learnings, and key takeaways from our journey to develop CAPC – the CAPI Provider for Apache CloudStack.

<div>Philipp explains the best performing Open Source software-defined storage software available to Apache CloudStack today. It consists of two well-concerted components. LINSTOR and DRBD. Each of them also has its independent use cases, where it is deployed alone. In this presentation, the combination of these two is examined. They form the control plane and the data plane of the SDS. We will touch on: Performance, scalability, hyper-convergence (data-locality for high IO performance), resiliency through data replication (synchronous within a site, 2-way, 3-way, or more), snapshots, backup (to S3), encryption at rest, deduplication, compression, placement policies (regarding failure domains), management CLI and webGUI, monitoring interface, self-healing (restoring redundancy after device/node failure), the federation of multiple sites (async mirroring and repeatedly snapshot difference shipping), QoS control (noisy neighbors limitation) and of course: complete integration with CloudStack for KVM guests. It is Open Source software following the Unix philosophy. Each component solves one task, made for maximal re-usability. The solution leverages the Linux kernel, LVM and/or ZFS, and many Open Source software libraries. Building on these giant Open Source foundations, not only saves LINBIT from re-inventing the wheels, it also empowers your day 2 operation teams since they are already familiar with these technologies.</div>

Every cloud service provider wants to boost their sales, but how? With the help of Stack Console’s reseller management module and CloudStack, a data center or cloud service provider can build resellers/partners and provide them with an automated white-label cloud management platform so they can sell cloud services under their own brand, such as compute, Kubernetes, load balancer, block storage, and so on. Many of resellers are likely to be small and medium-sized businesses that want to get into the cloud market, so this is great news for them. Service providers will still make money whether a customer buys a service directly from them or through one of their resellers.

Each CloudStack update is a critical process to prevent production issues. At DIMSI, we aim to reduce downtimes and regressions as much as possible for our end users. We are now implementing automated UI Tests to cover all main use cases whenever a new release is published. Navid and Magali give an overview of how it is being done, and the next steps, including potential integration inside the code project.

CloudStack’s VM placement policies don’t fit the current need of the industry. We have to create external tools to load balance VMs on hosts. We have an idea (which is under heavy development) to implement an AI algorithm to manage VM placement on a host. The algorithm is triggered based on a criteria (like when there is no place for a VM with 64G Ram and 32 core), which results in changing the placement of the VMs on a system.

The following link provides a complete list of Resources and Data Sources: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudstack/cloudstack/latest/docs I am a GSoC contributor for 2022 and am extending the list of Terraform Data Sources and Resources offered by CloudStack Terraform. I am currently working on the following project: CloudStack Terraform Provider – Add datasources for the existing resources https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/ZVraist1 I would like to present a tutorial/workshop as a knowledge transfer session. As CloudStack continues to grow in terms of resources, an explanation of how to extend Terraform provider will be beneficial to anyone who is interested in this area. In addition, I will share technical details regarding the provider during the presentation.
