The conference is being held in Santa Clara, CA from Sunday June 23 through Tuesday June 25.</p>

<p>The Collaboration Conference will feature tracks for users, developers, and integrators of Apache CloudStack. We&#8217;re looking for presentations that provide insight into best practices in deploying and developing Apache CloudStack. </p>

<p>This will be an outstanding opportunity for developers to collaborate, exchange ideas, and get work done face-to-face with other Apache CloudStack contributors to improve Apache CloudStack.</p>

<h2 id="proposals">Proposals</h2>

<p>The program committee will be looking for presentations and workshops related to working with and developing Apache CloudStack. This includes everything from running CloudStack at scale, best practices for working with IaaS clouds, discussions about CloudStack&#8217;s architecture, proposals for feature development, and more. We&#8217;re also open to talks that go hand-in-hand with managing Apache CloudStack, like configuration management and monitoring tools. </p>

<p>In short, if it&#8217;s relevant to Apache CloudStack development, deployment, and integration, we&#8217;re interested in what you might have to say. For an example of what we&#8217;re looking for, check out some of the <a href="http://is.gd/CCC12vids">videos from last year&#8217;s event</a>.</p>
