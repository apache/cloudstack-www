Due to missing validation checks for KVM-compatible templates in CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.4 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.2, an attacker that can register templates, can use them to deploy malicious instances on KVM-based environments and exploit this to gain access to the host filesystems that could result in the compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality, data loss, denial of service, and availability of KVM-based infrastructure managed by CloudStack.</p><p>Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.5 or 4.19.1.3, or later, which addresses this issue.</p><p>Additionally, all user-registered KVM-compatible templates can be scanned and checked that they are flat files that should not be using any additional or unnecessary features. For example, operators can run the following command on their file-based primary storage(s) and inspect the output. An empty output for the disk being validated means it has no references to the host filesystems; on the other hand, if the output for the disk being validated is not empty, it might indicate a compromised disk. However, bear in mind that (i) volumes created from templates will have references for the templates at first and (ii) volumes can be consolidated while migrating, losing their references to the templates. Therefore, the command execution for the primary storages can show both false positives and false negatives.</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*); do echo "Retrieving file [$file] info.

Due to missing validation checks for KVM-compatible templates or volumes in CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.3 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1, an attacker that can upload or register templates and volumes, can use them to deploy malicious instances or attach uploaded volumes to their existing instances on KVM-based environments and exploit this to gain access to the host filesystems that could result in the compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality, data loss, denial of service, and availability of KVM-based infrastructure managed by CloudStack.</p><p>Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.4 or 4.19.1.2, or later, which addresses this issue.</p><p>Additionally, all user-uploaded or registered KVM-compatible templates and volumes can be scanned and checked that they are flat files that should not be using any additional or unnecessary features. For example, operators can run this on their secondary storage(s) and inspect output. An empty output for the disk being validated means it has no references to the host filesystems; on the other hand, if the output for the disk being validated is not empty, it might indicate a compromised disk.</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">for file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\-]*.*); do echo "Retrieving file [$file] info.

VMware vSphere is a robust cloud infrastructure and management solution that combines vSphere and vRealize Suite, providing automation and operations capabilities for traditional and modern infrastructure and apps. However, the transition to Apache CloudStack can offer enhanced profitability and competitiveness. Marco delved into the benefits of Apache CloudStack, including its cost-effectiveness and open-source nature, and discussed how a gradual migration from VMware vCloud can reduce ownership costs, increase profitability, and enhance competitiveness. Marco also covered the practical steps and considerations in planning and executing this transition effectively.</p><p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/MTqaiZfT3UGqBx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/transitioning-520db4f83760f0c7e5980852eff9401c.png" title="transitioning away from vmware - slides" width="1718" height="961" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="internet-facing-vms-and-the-ddos-problem-wido-den-hollander-youronline">Internet Facing VMs and the DDoS Problem, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/widodh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wido den Hollander</a>, <a href="https://your.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your.Online</a><a href="#internet-facing-vms-and-the-ddos-problem-wido-den-hollander-youronline" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to internet-facing-vms-and-the-ddos-problem-wido-den-hollander-youronline" title="Direct link to internet-facing-vms-and-the-ddos-problem-wido-den-hollander-youronline">​</a></h2><p>When connected to the internet, it is probably just a matter of time before one of your VMs is under a DDoS attack.

<a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/releases/tag/4.19.1.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4.19.1.1</a> that
address CVE-2024-42062 and CVE-2024-42222, both of severity rating 'critical',
explained below.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cve-2024-42062-user-key-exposure-to-domain-admins"><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2024-42062</a>: User Key Exposure to Domain Admins<a href="#cve-2024-42062-user-key-exposure-to-domain-admins" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to cve-2024-42062-user-key-exposure-to-domain-admins" title="Direct link to cve-2024-42062-user-key-exposure-to-domain-admins">​</a></h2><p>CloudStack account-users by default use username and password based
authentication for API and UI access. Account-users can generate and
register randomised API and secret keys and use them for the purpose
of API-based automation and integrations. Due to access permission
validation issue that affects Apache CloudStack versions 4.10.0 upto
4.19.1.0, domain admin accounts were found to be able to query all
registered account-users API and secret keys in an environment
including that of a root admin. An attacker who has domain admin
access, can exploit this to gain root admin and other-account
privileges and perform malicious operations that can result in
compromise of resources integrity and confidentiality, data loss,
denial of service and availability of CloudStack managed
infrastructure.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cve-2024-42222-unauthorised-network-list-access"><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42222" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2024-42222</a>: Unauthorised Network List Access<a href="#cve-2024-42222-unauthorised-network-list-access" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to cve-2024-42222-unauthorised-network-list-access" title="Direct link to cve-2024-42222-unauthorised-network-list-access">​</a></h2><p>In Apache CloudStack 4.19.1.0, a regression in the network listing API
allows unauthorised list access of network details for domain admin
and normal user accounts. This vulnerability compromises tenant
isolation, potentially leading to unauthorised access to network
details, configurations and data.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="credits">Credits<a href="#credits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Credits" title="Direct link to Credits">​</a></h2><p>The CVEs are credited to the following reporters:</p><ul><li><p>CVE-2024-42062:</p><ul><li>Fabricio Duarte</li></ul></li><li><p>CVE-2024-42222:</p><ul><li>Christian Gross of Netcloud AG</li><li>Midhun Jose</li></ul></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="affected-versions">Affected versions:<a href="#affected-versions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Affected versions:" title="Direct link to Affected versions:">​</a></h2><ul><li><p>CVE-2024-42062 affects the following versions:</p><ul><li>Apache CloudStack 4.10.0 through 4.18.2.2</li><li>Apache CloudStack 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.0</li></ul></li><li><p>CVE-2024-42222 affect the following version:</p><ul><li>Apache CloudStack 4.19.1.0</li></ul></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="resolution">Resolution<a href="#resolution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Resolution" title="Direct link to Resolution">​</a></h2><p>Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.2.3, 4.19.1.1 or later, which

'important' explained below.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cve-2024-41107-saml-signature-exclusion"><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2024-41107</a>: SAML Signature Exclusion<a href="#cve-2024-41107-saml-signature-exclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to cve-2024-41107-saml-signature-exclusion" title="Direct link to cve-2024-41107-saml-signature-exclusion">​</a></h2><p>The CloudStack SAML authentication (disabled by default) does not enforce
signature check. In CloudStack environments where SAML authentication is
enabled, an attacker that initiates CloudStack SAML single sign-on
authentication can bypass SAML authentication by submitting a spoofed SAML
response with no signature and known or guessed username and other user
details of a SAML-enabled CloudStack user-account. In such environments,
this can result in a complete compromise of the resources owned and/or
accessible by a SAML enabled user-account.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="credits">Credits<a href="#credits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Credits" title="Direct link to Credits">​</a></h2><p>The original issue was reported by Christian Gross of Netcloud AG who filed

'important', explained below.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cve-2024-38346-unauthenticated-cluster-service-port-leads-to-remote-execution"><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2024-38346</a>: Unauthenticated cluster service port leads to remote execution<a href="#cve-2024-38346-unauthenticated-cluster-service-port-leads-to-remote-execution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to cve-2024-38346-unauthenticated-cluster-service-port-leads-to-remote-execution" title="Direct link to cve-2024-38346-unauthenticated-cluster-service-port-leads-to-remote-execution">​</a></h2><p>The CloudStack cluster service runs on unauthenticated port (default 9090) that
can be misused to run arbitrary commands on targeted hypervisors and CloudStack
management server hosts. Some of these commands were found to have command
injection vulnerabilities that can result in arbitrary code execution via agents
on the hosts that may run as a privileged user. An attacker that can reach the
cluster service on the unauthenticated port (default 9090), can exploit this to
perform remote code execution on CloudStack managed hosts and result in complete
compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CloudStack
managed infrastructure.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cve-2024-39864-integration-api-service-uses-dynamic-port-when-disabled"><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2024-39864</a>: Integration API service uses dynamic port when disabled<a href="#cve-2024-39864-integration-api-service-uses-dynamic-port-when-disabled" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to cve-2024-39864-integration-api-service-uses-dynamic-port-when-disabled" title="Direct link to cve-2024-39864-integration-api-service-uses-dynamic-port-when-disabled">​</a></h2><p>The CloudStack integration API service allows running its unauthenticated API
server (usually on port 8096 when configured and enabled via
integration.api.port global setting) for internal portal integrations and for
testing purposes. By default, the integration API service port is disabled and
is considered disabled when integration.api.port is set to 0 or negative. Due to
an improper initialisation logic, the integration API service would listen on a
random port when its port value is set to 0 (default value). An attacker that
can access the CloudStack management network could scan and find the randomised
integration API service port and exploit it to perform unauthorised
administrative actions and perform remote code execution on CloudStack managed
hosts and result in complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of CloudStack managed infrastructure.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="credits">Credits<a href="#credits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Credits" title="Direct link to Credits">​</a></h2><p>Both the CVEs are credited to the following reporters from the Apple Services

Veronezi has taken on the role of Vice President (VP) of Apache
CloudStack recently, a position that bridges the gap between the
vibrant community of developers and users and the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF) board. In this new role, Daniel is entrusted with
ensuring the health and growth of both the project and its community,
guiding its further development while fostering a collaborative
environment.</p><p>In our exclusive interview with Daniel, we explore the
responsibilities and vision he brings to this role. As he explains,
the VP’s primary duty is to serve as a liaison, ensuring effective
communication and alignment between the CloudStack community and the
ASF board. Despite holding this significant title, Daniel emphasizes
that the VP role carries no extra privilege or weight in
decision-making compared to other Project Management Committee (PMC)
members. His focus will be on maintaining a healthy community and
steering the project towards its future goals.</p><p>CloudStack has been a game-changer for many companies, particularly
those seeking an easy-to-deploy, robust cloud management
solution. With its latest enhancements, including advanced billing and
white-label capabilities, CloudStack is ideal for digital service
providers and companies managing large-scale virtual machine (VM)
environments. Telecom companies and cloud providers, in particular,
stand to benefit from CloudStack's ability to streamline VM
management, enhance security, and provide detailed cost and resource
tracking. Read the full interview below.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-exactly-is-the-role-of-vp-of-apache-cloudstack">What exactly is the role of VP of Apache CloudStack?<a href="#what-exactly-is-the-role-of-vp-of-apache-cloudstack" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What exactly is the role of VP of Apache CloudStack?" title="Direct link to What exactly is the role of VP of Apache CloudStack?">​</a></h4><p>The main role of a VP is to interface between the community/project
and the ASF board. The VP is not different from the other PMC members;
therefore, there is no privilege or greater weight in decisions for
the person acting as VP. However, the VP is entrusted with
guaranteeing the health of the community and also guiding the further
development of the project and its community.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cloudstack-has-played-a-critical-role-for-many-solutions-providers-and-companies-seeking-ease-of-use-and-deployment-which-companies-can-benefit-the-most-from-cloudstack">CloudStack has played a critical role for many solutions providers and companies seeking ease of use and deployment.

Which companies can benefit the most from CloudStack?" title="Direct link to CloudStack has played a critical role for many solutions providers and companies seeking ease of use and deployment. Which companies can benefit the most from CloudStack?">​</a></h4><p>The latest billing and white-label capabilities make Apache CloudStack
an ideal choice for cloud and digital service providers. However, for
any company that needs to manage virtual machines (VMs) to run their
workloads, CloudStack can help them to better visualize costs and the
workloads and ease their management while adding security mechanisms,
awareness of the resources applied in each project/application, and
auditing tools with respect to infrastructure changes in the VMs where
they run. The most benefits of CloudStack come when one needs to
support large cloud environments. Therefore, CloudStack is a reliable
alternative for companies that handle several sites, like Telecoms and
cloud providers.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/Daniel-inside-861100dd02bf9b41b6aeef1216c78354.png" title="Blog Quote: Cloud computing is a fundamental
technology for organizations that aspire to optimize their data center
operations. As a whole, CloudStack excels in orchestrating cloud
environments; it has been the choice of many companies for years. With

become the cornerstone of most cloud providers." width="1200" height="628" class="img_ev3q"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="choosing-a-cloud-management-system-is-a-hard-thing-especially-if-you-have-a-long-history-with-specific-technologies-why-should-companies-migrate-to-cloudstack">Choosing a cloud management system is a hard thing, especially if you have a long history with specific technologies.

Why should companies migrate to CloudStack?" title="Direct link to Choosing a cloud management system is a hard thing, especially if you have a long history with specific technologies. Why should companies migrate to CloudStack?">​</a></h4><p>Before choosing a technology to adopt as the basis of the cloud, the
service provider needs to define its requirements, look for
alternatives, and understand how it can address its needs. It all
depends on the list of requirements, and the operating team that the
company has. Most time, digital services companies will find out that
CloudStack is the best option, with its easy-to-use graphical
interface, market-ready structure, advanced features, reduced
operating costs, and so on.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="on-the-development-side-how-easy-it-is-to-implement-and-manage-cloudstack">On the development side, how easy it is to implement and manage CloudStack?<a href="#on-the-development-side-how-easy-it-is-to-implement-and-manage-cloudstack" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to On the development side, how easy it is to implement and manage CloudStack?" title="Direct link to On the development side, how easy it is to implement and manage CloudStack?">​</a></h4><p>Once you understand the CloudStack code structure, it is not
hard. However, we (the community) have to understand that we have
several development barriers. We are already working with a highly
complex context; to work with CloudStack, developers need to
understand storage, networking, virtualization, Internet protocols,
and much more. On top of that, we do not use mainstream/standardized
frameworks for the RESTful APIs and JPA; we use Spring in a
non-standard fashion; we do not have a solid standard between our
APIs, and so on. We are constantly increasing the complexity to
extend/evolve and maintain ACS. That creates a bubble of development
where it is hard to join, which is not healthy for a community. In
fact, we already had cases of people leaving the project because of
its barriers. I believe the first step toward removing those barriers
is to clearly define our subjective processes, like deprecating old
API methods, technologies, and development standards in favor of
mainstream/standardized frameworks and technologies. For that, we have
a discussion running in the community, and I invite our readers to
join it: <a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/discussions/8970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/discussions/8970</a>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-would-you-share-about-the-community">What would you share about the community?<a href="#what-would-you-share-about-the-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What would you share about the community?" title="Direct link to What would you share about the community?">​</a></h4><p>The CloudStack community is very active and is always bringing new use
cases and innovation for the project. That is very interesting for the
evolution of the project. We are constantly growing and developing
further without being tied to a single vendor. That is in fact on of
the reasons that attracts most organizations to Apache CloudStack. The
diversity of its culture and community.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-you-think-we-can-all-grow-the-cloudstack-community">How do you think we can all grow the CloudStack community?<a href="#how-do-you-think-we-can-all-grow-the-cloudstack-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do you think we can all grow the CloudStack community?" title="Direct link to How do you think we can all grow the CloudStack community?">​</a></h4><p>The first step towards growing the community is to admit where we are
going wrong and work to fix our errors. As mentioned before, we have
some development barriers; and casting light on that allows us to work
on solutions. By doing that, we enable more people to contribute to
the community more easily. We have to guarantee that all the
contributors are being evaluated by the same criteria, not using
double standards. Another thing that I and my colleagues have been
considering is to host a conference in Brazil in the near
future. Latin America has lots of players in the telecom and
cloud-providing scenario using CloudStack as their cloud orchestrator;
however, due to several factors, not all of them participate in the
community or attend international conferences. Therefore, promoting
even more CloudStack in Latin America can motivate them to participate
and grow the community even more here, both users and contributors.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-direction-in-which-apache-cloudstack-is-going-as-a-technology">What is the direction in which Apache CloudStack is going as a technology?<a href="#what-is-the-direction-in-which-apache-cloudstack-is-going-as-a-technology" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the direction in which Apache CloudStack is going as a technology?" title="Direct link to What is the direction in which Apache CloudStack is going as a technology?">​</a></h4><p>Cloud computing is a fundamental technology for organizations that
aspire to optimize their data center operations. As a whole,
CloudStack excels in orchestrating cloud environments; it has been the
choice of many companies for years. With adequate maintenance and
development of the project, CloudStack will become the cornerstone of
most cloud providers.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="many-community-members-notice-that-cloudstack-is-becoming-more-and-more-appealing-for-enterprises-what-would-you-advise-this-type-of-organization">Many community members notice that CloudStack is becoming more and more appealing for enterprises.

What would you advise this type of organization?" title="Direct link to Many community members notice that CloudStack is becoming more and more appealing for enterprises.

"brick and mortar" business are getting more and more
digitalized. Companies running large datacenters will find out that
CloudStack is one of the best options, with its easy-to-use graphical
interface, market-ready structure, advanced features, and so on. My
advice to organizations adopting CloudStack is to study and understand
its powerful features and develop solutions based on CloudStack's
numerous functionalities.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="as-a-person-you-are-recognized-for-your-contribution-to-cloudstack-how-did-you-start-with-it">As a person, you are recognized for your contribution to CloudStack.

How did you start with it?" title="Direct link to As a person, you are recognized for your contribution to CloudStack. How did you start with it?">​</a></h4><p>My CloudStack journey started in December 2020 when I started to work
at SC Clouds. At first, my tasks were focused on understanding how
CloudStack works and troubleshooting situations. Аfterwards, I started
developing/improving features, reviewing patches, discussing
solutions, and helping the community through the mailing lists. As I
got more and more involved, my goals and focus changed, and now most
of my efforts are on designing features and guiding/mentoring others
through the community. Currently, I am mentoring more than 10 people
in the community who are my colleagues in SC Clouds.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="any-advice-to-all-developers-writing-new-features-for-cloudstack">Any advice to all developers writing new features for CloudStack?<a href="#any-advice-to-all-developers-writing-new-features-for-cloudstack" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Any advice to all developers writing new features for CloudStack?" title="Direct link to Any advice to all developers writing new features for CloudStack?">​</a></h4><p>CloudStack is a complex project; therefore, before starting the
development of big features, it is crucial to create a specification,
so that the necessary changes are mapped, structured, and
documented. We are a community with people from different places and
we have different cultures, knowledge, experiences, and ways of
thinking. If we do not clearly document what we are doing, it gets
hard for others to maintain and evolve the features, creating a bubble
of development, which is not healthy for the community. Furthermore,
if one does not have a specification for the feature being developed,
unnecessary code might get changed. With more code touched, more
errors and bugs could be introduced. Another important point is to
understand the root cause of the situations faced. It is common to see
PRs intended to solve a problem by adding workarounds because the root
causes of the problem are never understood; however, several times
those workarounds add unnecessary complexity to the project and do not
fully address the situation; they might even introduce other bugs and
situations. It is very important to understand what is happening and
act precisely.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="if-you-need-to-summarize-cloudstack-in-3-words-what-would-they-be">If you need to summarize CloudStack in 3 words, what would they be?<a href="#if-you-need-to-summarize-cloudstack-in-3-words-what-would-they-be" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to If you need to summarize CloudStack in 3 words, what would they be?" title="Direct link to If you need to summarize CloudStack in 3 words, what would they be?">​</a></h4><p>I think they would be: stable, resilient, and innovative.</p>]]></content:encoded>

organizations decided to adopt. KVM is a widely used hypervisor with a
vibrant community and support in different operating system
distributions. While developing the KVM plugin functionalities, one
normally tries to make use of the full potential of the
hypervisor. However, while Libvirt, the toolkit used by ACS to manage
KVM VMs, already supports native incremental snapshots, every volume
snapshot/backup taken with ACS is a full snapshot/backup. In many
situations, always taking full snapshots of volumes is costly for both
the storage network and storage systems. This presentation will
address the design and efforts of the ACS community to support
incremental snapshots/backups for the KVM plugin. Thus, creating a
native backup solution in ACS that supports differential copies.</p><h6 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vnf-integration-and-support-in-apache-cloudstack-wei-zhou--tuesday-4th-at-1610--1640-harmony-1">VNF Integration and Support in Apache CloudStack, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-zhou-3635b633/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wei Zhou</a> – Tuesday 4th at 16:10 – 16:40 (Harmony 1)<a href="#vnf-integration-and-support-in-apache-cloudstack-wei-zhou--tuesday-4th-at-1610--1640-harmony-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to vnf-integration-and-support-in-apache-cloudstack-wei-zhou--tuesday-4th-at-1610--1640-harmony-1" title="Direct link to vnf-integration-and-support-in-apache-cloudstack-wei-zhou--tuesday-4th-at-1610--1640-harmony-1">​</a></h6><p>In this session, Wei will present how CloudStack 4.19 adds the

x-forwarded-for HTTP header and logs it as the source IP of an API
request. This could lead to authentication bypass and other
operational problems should an attacker decide to spoof their IP
address this way.</p><p>Affected versions: Apache CloudStack 4.11.0.0 through 4.18.1.0, and 4.19.0.0</p><p>Credit: Yuyang Xiao &lt; <a href="mailto:superxyyang@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">superxyyang@gmail.com</a> &gt; (finder)</p><p><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CVE-2024-29007</strong></a>: When

configuration (extraconfig) feature which can be misused by anyone who
has privilege to deploy a VM instance or configure settings of an
already deployed VM instance, to configure additional VM configuration
even when the feature is not explicitly enabled by the administrator.
In a KVM based CloudStack environment, an attacker can exploit this
issue to attach host devices such as storage disks, and PCI and USB
devices such as network adapters and GPUs, in a regular VM instance
that can be further exploited to gain access to the underlying network
and storage infrastructure resources, and access any VM instance disks
on the local storage.</p><p>Credit: Wei Zhou &lt; <a href="mailto:ustcweizhou@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ustcweizhou@gmail.com</a> &gt; (finder)</p>]]></content:encoded>

investment if incorrect choices are made in delivering both public and
private cloud solutions.</p><p>CloudStack is a turnkey solution for cloud builders and managed
service providers. Being entirely open-source, it is user-friendly,
easy to implement, manage, and scale. CloudStack is also backed by a
large open-source community and adheres to rapid release
cycles. Apache CloudStack assists cloud builders in overcoming key
challenges such as costs, avoiding vendor lock-in, and efficiently
managing a multitude of physical servers spread across geographically
distributed data centers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Proprietary DR solutions often proved to
be prohibitively expensive for many organizations. A telecom company in Asia
approached StackBill with the specific requirement of a DR solution based on open-
source technology. The objective was clear: to reduce costs, increase profitability,
and ensure business continuity by quickly recovering from catastrophic events.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="apache-cloudstack-a-foundation-for-success">Apache CloudStack: A Foundation for Success<a href="#apache-cloudstack-a-foundation-for-success" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Apache CloudStack: A Foundation for Success" title="Direct link to Apache CloudStack: A Foundation for Success">​</a></h3><p>Apache CloudStack was chosen as the cornerstone of the DR solution. This open-source cloud computing platform is highly scalable and offers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) capabilities. It provides the flexibility to deploy and manage large networks of virtual machines, making it ideal for delivering public cloud services and on-premises or hybrid cloud solutions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ceph-storage-ensuring-data-resilience">CEPH Storage: Ensuring Data Resilience<a href="#ceph-storage-ensuring-data-resilience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CEPH Storage: Ensuring Data Resilience" title="Direct link to CEPH Storage: Ensuring Data Resilience">​</a></h3><p>Ceph, an open-source storage platform, was selected for its ability to offer object, block, and file storage from a single system. Its self-healing and self- managed features reduce administrative overhead, allowing it to handle outages autonomously.
The decision to opt for open-source solutions was driven by the prohibitive costs and limitations of proprietary alternatives.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementation">Implementation<a href="#implementation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementation" title="Direct link to Implementation">​</a></h4><p>The DR solution was implemented between active zones for selective VMs. Leveraging Ceph's RBD Mirror Snapshot feature, the system could schedule and move data to the DR location and vice versa. StackBill's DR Control tool played a crucial role in managing the failover process. Importantly, this DR solution was achieved without any modifications to CloudStack. A Complete DR Solution involves compatible network and storage solutions. They have collaborated with client’s network team and offered solutions with storage and StackBill.</p><p>In the realm of cloud computing, Disaster Recovery (DR) has historically posed significant challenges. However, StackBill's pioneering journey showcases the attainability of cost-effective and efficient solutions. By harnessing open-source technologies, notably Apache CloudStack and Ceph Storage, StackBill not only achieved substantial cost reductions but also fortified business continuity for its clients.</p><br><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-case-study-stackbill.pdf">Download the Case Study</a><br>]]></content:encoded>

services. The company offers wireless communications, data/broadband
and internet services, local and long-distance telephone services,
telecommunications equipment, managed networking, and wholesale
services. AT&amp;T is a 125+ year old telecommunications company based in
Dallas, Texas. Their main purpose is to create connection – a
connection to friends, family, work, commerce, education, health,
entertainment and more by using advanced technology and delivering
services globally.</p><p>During the annual CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2023, Alex
Dometrius, Associate Director - Technology at AT&amp;T, presented the talk
CloudStack and GitOps at Enterprise Scale, where he outlined their
journey with Apache CloudStack and the architecture they used to
managed their CloudStack-based platform using GitOps.</p><p>In the spirit of continuous improvement, Alex’s team looked for an
opportunity to improve on how they do infrastructure provisioning
within the enterprise ultimately leading to deployment of CloudStack.</p><p>After reviewing a few different cloud management platforms, AT&amp;T
decided to deploy CloudStack as a centrally-managed and
centrally-supported IaaS platform, because if its multi-tenancy,
allowing the application teams within the business to maintain their
own-dedicated environments. Other reasons to choose CloudStack were
the CloudStack Terraform Provider and Native APIs, over-provisioning
capabilities and ability to manage the CloudStack-based platform using
GitOps.</p><p>In their talk during the CloudStack Collaboration Conference, Alex
Dometrius shares more about the issued solved and the success with
CloudStack. As a follow up of their talk at the event, we asked a few
questions to the AT&amp;T team, to understand more about their choice of
technology and learn for their experience of managing infrastructure
at a large-scale and enterprise level.</p><iframe width="100%" height="480p" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bc1a8YHdEq4?si=V7QZM660_YS9pjKp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;

open-source projects and we strive to use open-source technology
wherever possible. At risk of stating the cliché benefits of using
open-source software, there are several reasons why we lean towards
open-source solutions. Cost of entry is generally lower when deploying
open-source which allows us to deliver solutions to the business much
faster. These costs can also remain lower if there is an active
user/contributor community like what we found with CloudStack.</p><strong>During your talk, you mentioned running PoCs of CloudStack and other technologies. What do you recommended to be tested during a PoC?</strong><p>Why you chose CloudStack? Each use case is different obviously. The
scale of the implementation, how users will interact with the
platform, how migration from present state to future state can be
carried out when deploying a new cloud platform are all items we took
into consideration. As mentioned, CloudStack checked several of the
requirements we had: multi-tenancy capabilities, support for
infrastructure as code, project quota controls, an active open-source
community, etc.</p><strong>How does CloudStack fit with the other technologies AT&amp;T uses internally?</strong><p>CloudStack’s ability to support VMWare was another reason we chose to
deploy it. We have an existing VMWare footprint and we chose
CloudStack as a mechanism to help continue to support VMWare workloads
while also moving to a KVM-focused VM platform. For our team, it was
less about how CloudStack fit into our existing technology stack, as
this stack has a lot of legacy, home-grown tools, and more about the
capabilities CloudStack will provide as an enabler for us to move to a
more modern private cloud platform.</p><strong>Do you run your datacenter ipv4 or ipv4/ipv6 or ipv6 only?</strong><p>Both ipv4 and ipv6.</p><strong>Why don’t you push back your container image cloudstack mgmt to the community? Do you have plans to contribute to the community?</strong><p>We have already begun contributing back to the community as mentioned
with our <a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/7889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PR for fiber channel multi-path for
KVM</a>. We will look at
what makes sense to contribute regarding the cloudstack management
container.</p><strong>What workloads are managed by CloudStack?</strong><p>Our expectation is essentially all workloads in the enterprise
can/could be managed with CloudStack. Web applications, Kubernetes
clusters, databases, etc.</p><h4>More about AT&amp;T: <a href="https://www.att.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.att.com</a></h4>]]></content:encoded>

source license they were distributing their software on. More and more it feels
like Open Source is just a marketing buzzword designed to lure customers to a
particular solution. On the regulatory front, the EU is implementing the CRA and
handling software as it were trucks manufacturing. Is there any hope left for
Open Source? Has it failed in delivering its premise? Fear not. Open Source’s
not dead. It has already won and it will prevail again.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEWBox97qG4&amp;si=cJ7ZVRnaSBK5l9k9&amp;controls=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/03-keynote-68b465264433a765f594be0ed983122b.png" title="Open Source is Not Dead - video" width="1152" height="536" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/8AqGBCIdZV8jFe?hostedIn=slideshare&amp;page=upload" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/03-keynote-efb54dca1359227bdad605824688810c.png" title="Open Source is Not Dead - slides" width="1152" height="650" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-and-how-cloudstack-at-wesystems-stephan-bienek">Why and How CloudStack at weSystems, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-bienek-66aa69206/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephan Bienek</a><a href="#why-and-how-cloudstack-at-wesystems-stephan-bienek" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-and-how-cloudstack-at-wesystems-stephan-bienek" title="Direct link to why-and-how-cloudstack-at-wesystems-stephan-bienek">​</a></h3><p>Why?

providing resources in terms of tools and infrastructure. In a university, a
makerspace provides students with an opportunity to build a portfolio. Students
experiment through an entire development life cycle by creating prototypes for
each stage of a cycle. It has been shown to be a productive method for learning.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, software development is yet to be included in the
makerspace concept. In the case of our software makerspace, it is following the
same principles as a traditional makerspace for device and mechanical
prototyping, but instead provides software development tools. One such
indispensable tool is cloud-based infrastructure. A cloud facilitates rapid
prototyping of machine learning tools, microservices, IoT data mining, etc.</p><p>This talk presents their approach to extend the concept of a makerspace to
software development using a student developed private cloud. They present the
method they used to gather requirements from various researchers and students.
They also present the final design and the current implementation of the cloud
using Apache CloudStack. Finally, they discuss how other universities could
implement their own software makerspace and its benefits.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYT1HA6krU4&amp;si=2OD0flTkxgZvRV9x&amp;controls=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/19-makerspace-13de1016967333e4b68b1faeb3865270.png" title="Building a Software Makerspace with CloudStack - video" width="1576" height="724" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/ghw7Vj1Kvco7t?hostedIn=slideshare&amp;page=upload" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/18-kth-df9af0741029057fb0dd49f9a500113e.png" title="Building a Software Makerspace with CloudStack - slides" width="1152" height="639" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="drbd-deep-dive-philipp-reisner">DRBD Deep Dive, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-reisner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philipp Reisner</a><a href="#drbd-deep-dive-philipp-reisner" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to drbd-deep-dive-philipp-reisner" title="Direct link to drbd-deep-dive-philipp-reisner">​</a></h3><p>LINSTOR/DRBD became a primary storage option for Apache CloudStack nearly two years ago.

storage and networking. The hardware that the VMs access is implemented in
software and/or by passing through a dedicated hardware device. Software-based
solutions consume extra CPU cycles, thus resulting in poor performance. Also,
these require to expose a device-model to the guest, thus increasing the attack
surface. Conversely, hardware passthrough provides better performance and
security but can be expensive in terms of the number of physical resources,
since each device is dedicated to a single VM. This talk focuses on how Vates is
working on sharing hardware resources among VMs by relying on dedicated
processors named Data Processing Units (DPU). More precisely, Vates work on
offloading Xen hypervisor of storage emulation by relying on Kalray K200 DPU
PCIe controllers, a hardware accelerator based on MPPA architecture.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZQ2_f4FC6o&amp;si=P7rsd8zjrN24i8JL&amp;controls=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/30-DPU-d3dfdd5beb8c9248c31696481327db22.png" title="Enabling DPU Hardware Accelerators in XCP-ng - video" width="1152" height="535" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/toAUvWJuD5HvnH?hostedIn=slideshare&amp;page=upload" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/28-xcpng-7ba432b32fde7d45a0a6bd0ca1b5390a.png" title="Enabling DPU Hardware Accelerators in XCP-ng - slides" width="1152" height="644" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cloudstack-object-storage---an-introduction-vladimir-petrov">CloudStack Object Storage - An Introduction, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vladimir Petrov</a><a href="#cloudstack-object-storage---an-introduction-vladimir-petrov" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to cloudstack-object-storage---an-introduction-vladimir-petrov" title="Direct link to cloudstack-object-storage---an-introduction-vladimir-petrov">​</a></h3><p>CloudStack 4.19 introduces a new framework for object storage.

2023</a> is only a few weeks away. This year’s
event will be taking place in Paris and online, on 23-24th November.
<a href="https://events.hubilo.com/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2023/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Registration is still
open</a>,
with free tickets to anybody interested in the open-source project or cloud
technology. The event’s agenda has also been released, which you can see when
registering for the event.</p><p>I decided to interview the project’s current VP, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohityadavcloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rohit
Yadav</a>, to get his thoughts on the
annual event.</p><p><strong>Why should individuals and organisations in the cloud industry be excited to
attend CloudStack Collab 2023?</strong></p><p><em>“I think the conference gives a great opportunity to everyone in the community,
be it an individual, a small and midsize business, or an enterprise, to
participate, collaborate, learn about what is coming in CloudStack and to meet
and network with people.</em></p><p><em>CloudStack Conferences and events provide a neutral space for the community to
come together, interact and learn about ongoing and future development of the
project, influence the direction of the project and form potential partnership
with one-another to support their objectives. This can also ensure long-term
stability of the contributor base, participation and health of the project.</em></p><p><em>The benefit of a hybrid event is those who aren't able to attend the conference
in person can still participate online, and watch the video streams or the
recordings later on.</em></p><p><em>It can also benefit people looking to learn about reducing cloud costs. It is
not a new thing that companies around the world are under financial pressure. We
have seen through various scenarios in the past, that moving from VMware to
CloudStack, or moving away from Hyperscalers to CloudStack can significantly
reduce the cost of ownership. So, the conference and its videos can help a lot
of people who are considering CloudStack, as well as those already implementing
it.”</em></p><p><strong>Are there any specific talks that stand out to you and that you are most looking forward to?</strong></p><p><em>“There are certainly several talks that I am really excited about – these are new
features in Apache CloudStack, use-cases of CloudStack, as well as sessions from
thought leaders who are going to talk about their perspective on CloudStack and
open-source. So, I am particularly excited about these talks.”</em></p><p><strong>Can you give a sneak peek into your ‘State of the Union’ talk?</strong></p><p><em>“One of the things I did was look at what previous VPs spoke about in their
State of the Union talks. So, there will be content about the community, changes
since last years, updates about releases and reflecting on what happened in the
community, in the last year.</em></p><p><em>I will also look into trends in the community, whether that is from the mailing
lists or from GitHub, as well as discuss new initiatives in the community. I'm
still figuring out a theme to stitch the content that I already have and
I am reaching out to people and organisations for quotes in support of
CloudStack.”</em></p><p><strong>How do you feel the CloudStack community has evolved in recent years?</strong></p><p><em>“Just like the project itself, the community has matured a lot alongside it. We
have over a decade of CloudStack releases, making it a stable and mature
product. A lot of people have been with the project since the early days and
they have a stable and mature outlook on using CloudStack</em></p><p><em>A term that can be applied here is <a href="https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.mechanical-sympathy.en.html#:~:text=Mechanical%20sympathy%20is%20when%20you,Jackie%20Stewart%2C%20racing%20driver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mechanical
sympathy</a>,
which can explain how and why some people can become more intuitive than others
when it comes to the open-source software. As a result, CloudStack becomes an
extension of somebody who understands it better, as they will know its
limitations, thus meaning they know where to push it and where not to push it.”</em></p><p><strong>How does the CloudStack Collaboration Conference contribute to fostering
collaboration among the CloudStack community members?</strong></p><p><em>“There are a lot of users/vendors who have their idea of where CloudStack could
be extended and used. One of the great perks of CCC is that it gives networking
opportunities, where people can discuss their ideas, roadmaps and align with
others on where they want to see CloudStack go.</em></p><p><em>We have seen in the past where multiple parties have come together to push
CloudStack in a direction with respect to a feature or their roadmap or business
strategy.”</em></p><p><strong>Do you believe that open-source technologies will become more prevalent
among MSP’s and enterprises? If so, why? </strong></p><p><em>“Yes, I believe so. Any open-source project would have a community around it
and that it is easy to get access its the source code, modify and
redistribute it. What that unlocks is that for the same software, there might be
multiple vendors, which means there is not a vendor lock-in and therefore the
total cost of ownership is lower.</em></p><p><em>Open-source also fosters innovation, as every MSP or enterprise will have their
own roadmap and things they want to do with the software. Achieving these
objectives will require changes in the software, which is possible because
they’re not dependent on a vendor, meaning they can do it themselves or they can
partner with other parties in the relevant open-source ecosystem to achieve their
goals.”</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

The
CloudStack Collaboration Conference is back, and this time it's happening in
Paris on November 23-24.</p><p>The wait is finally over, as the conference agenda has just been released,
giving attendees the chance to plan their schedules and make the most of this
extraordinary gathering of cloud enthusiasts, developers, and industry leaders.</p><h1>A Glimpse into the Agenda</h1><p>The <a href="https://www.cloudstackcollab.org/#schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently released agenda</a>
offers a tantalizing glimpse into what attendees can expect over the two days of
the conference. With a diverse range of sessions and workshops, there's a wealth
of knowledge to be gained and connections to be made. Here are some highlights
from the agenda:</p><p><strong>State of the Union, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohityadavcloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rohit Yadav</a></strong></p><div class="row"><div class="col col--3"><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/rohit-df1c80f03df8fe310d0772769b58cb31.png" title="Rohit Yadav&quot; class=&quot;blog-image" width="211" height="199" class="img_ev3q"></p></div><div class="col col--9">In this session, Rohit will reflect on the last year of project collaboration, developments in CloudStack and community activity. He will set out how he sees the project developing over the next few years.</div></div><p><strong>Keynote Talk: Open Source is Not Dead, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesschulz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charles Schulz</a></strong></p><div class="row"><div class="col col--3"><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/charles-6bc2f1354f97e31a49781cb0b505e163.png" title="Charles Schulz" width="218" height="212" class="img_ev3q"></p></div><div class="col col--9">Successful open source companies change their business models and then the open source license they were distributing their software on. More and more it feels like Open Source is just a marketing buzzword designed to lure customers to a particular solution. On the regulatory front, the EU is implementing the CRA and handling software as it were trucks manufacturing. Is there any hope left for Open Source? Has it failed in delivering its premise?<p>Fear not. Open Source's not dead. It has already won and it will prevail again.</p></div></div><p><strong>What’s New in CloudStack and What Will Come in 4.19, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shwstppr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abhishek Kumar</a></strong></p><div class="row"><div class="col col--3"><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/abhishek-0dd4859719d2fed1f0ed60df0bfbcf18.png" title="Abhishek Kumar" width="290" height="254" class="img_ev3q"></p></div><div class="col col--9">Abhishek will give a brief introduction to the new and exciting features in the upcoming Apache CloudStack 4.19 release.</div></div><p><strong>How to Re-use Old Hardware with CloudStack.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/blog/gsoc-2023"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/banner-a9ada434623c0c0f625ef3f67c69ebf6.png" title="Google Summer of Code 2023 Review" width="1384" height="721" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>In the ever-evolving landscape of open-source software development, fostering
the growth of young talents and innovators is essential. One remarkable program
that stands at the forefront of this mission is the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Summer of Code
(GSoC)</a>. For years, GSoC has been an
invaluable platform for students to collaborate with prominent open-source
organizations, and Apache CloudStack is proud to be a part of this
transformative journey.</p><p>As an open-source Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform, Apache CloudStack
has consistently provided a robust, scalable, and reliable solution for building
and managing cloud environments. With a global community of developers and
contributors, CloudStack has had an ongoing commitment to the GSoC programme and
its students in the last years. We believe that young talents should be led in
their open-source journey and projects shall be willing to help them learn and
develop new skills and knowledge.</p><h1>A Word From this Year’s Participant and Mentor</h1><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/ayush-99b8c81091fd2c374e8abe2028e7ab5d.png" title="Ayush" width="97" height="128" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p>“Working on the Apache CloudStack project gave me the opportunity to understand
how cloud computing infrastructure as a service works, the usage of nested
virtualization and all other technical aspects involved.</p><p>The community has been really welcoming and supportive, and I’m excited to be a
part of this community.”</p><p>-<!-- -->&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/itsayushpandey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ayush Pandey</a>, GSoC 2023 Student</p></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/nicolas-e4954d436f405557c37e007ccbf404c6.png" title="Nicolas" width="128" height="129" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p>“I am very excited to be coordinating the CloudStack projects for the Google
Summer of Code 2023 and mentoring Ayush on his project. I think GSOC is a great
experience as an introduction to open-source projects and meeting its community,
and from the mentor side it’s a great opportunity to meet and support talented
people.”</p><p>-<!-- -->&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nvazquezuy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicolas Vazquez</a>, GSoC 2023 Mentor</p></blockquote><h1>The Impact of GSoC on Open-source Technologies</h1><p>In 2023, the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program made a resounding impact on
the world of open-source software development. With an impressive participation
of 966 new contributors from across the globe, GSoC facilitated their engagement
in 12+ week projects, collaborating with 168 open-source organizations. This
global initiative united mentors and contributors hailing from over 75
countries, creating a dynamic ecosystem of innovation and learning.</p><p>For nearly two decades, GSoC has thrived on the collective enthusiasm of
open-source communities and the dedication of 19,000+ volunteer mentors, each
spending between 50 to 150 hours guiding over 20,000 contributors since 2005. In
2023, this tradition continued with 168 mentoring organizations and a staggering
1,950 mentors supporting the program.</p><h1>A Preview of the Work Completed by GSoC Students</h1><p>This year, Ayush worked on adding implementation of import/export instances to
the KVM hypervisor. The unmanaging instance feature is only available for the
VMWare hypervisor in the latest version of CloudStack. This summer, Ayush worked
on extending it to the KVM hypervisor. Click here to learn more about his
project -  <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/f0gpheQM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/f0gpheQM</a></p><p>You can also see the CloudStack community submission to GitHub here -

Hoogland, held a talk, where he reviewed the involvement of CloudStack in GSoC,
and looked at some of the work done by the GSoC students.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDDoxFwhIvw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/daan-7e887a846b8c75426ffe0031451493e1.png" title="Daan on GSoC" width="1384" height="650" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

When launching a new Instance on Apache CloudStack, users can set a UserData
script to be executed by cloud-init during the boot process. The ‘CloudStack
Managed UserData’ feature extends this functionality allowing one to automate
the installation of packages, update the instance’s OS, and configure
applications during instance deployment. Managed UserData enables users to
register and manage their own UserData script(s) as a CloudStack resource. It
can be associated with a CloudStack Template/ISO, or when a new Instance is
being deployed.</p><p><strong>Speaker Bio:</strong>

process of digitalization and return customer focus to their business.</p><p>We try to build on open-source where possible, even if it means we take a few
more efforts in the beginning, we are convinced of the benefits of building on
open-source in the long run.”</p><p>-<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-bienek-66aa69206/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephan Bienek</a>, Head of Hosting, weSystems</p></blockquote><h1>A Quest for the Perfect Fit</h1><p>weSystems embarked on a journey to find the ideal platform for building a
multi-tenant IaaS cloud offering that could handle diverse workloads and support
managed hosting and application services. The chosen platform needed to
encompass several key features, including support for multiple zones,
multi-tenancy, integration with the Kubernetes ecosystem, Ceph Storage, and the
flexibility to create custom service offerings. After evaluating multiple
options, CloudStack emerged as the frontrunner, surpassing alternatives like
OpenStack, Proxmox, and VMware.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/brian-9cfe45a2da05f8f616e96dd58047f7cb.png" title="Brian" width="150" height="160" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p>“The rich feature set in computing, networking and UI/API’s flexibility, to
combine features fulfilling a new requirement whilst still keeping the ease of
operation and use is the perfect match for us.”</p><p>-<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-n%C3%B8rgaard-granh%C3%B8j-2b0a001/?originalSubdomain=dk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Nørgaard</a>, Director Nordic, weSystems ApS</p></blockquote><a class="button button--primary" target="_blank" href="/files/ACS-WeSystems-Case-Study.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY</a><br><br><h1>Empowering Complex Solutions</h1><p>The implementation journey began with a Proof of Concept (PoC) to evaluate
CloudStack's capabilities. It quickly became evident that CloudStack offered the
clarity of documentation, ease of setup, and daily operation that weSystems was
seeking. Once the PoC was established, they moved on to set up a productive zone
and simultaneously focused on developing automation processes, tooling, usage
tracking, and billing.</p><p>Through rigorous testing and adaptation, the team found that CloudStack's
versatility allowed them to address unexpected challenges effectively. The
platform seamlessly integrated into their technology stack components, promoting
operational efficiency and team trust. The ability to deploy standard and
customized virtual machines, along with a clean and intuitive Web UI and API,
facilitated easy adoption among the team and customers.</p><h1>Contributing to the Open-Source Community</h1><p>As advocates of open-source software, weSystems finds value in contributing to
CloudStack's ecosystem. They actively participate by proposing new
functionalities, contributing code to the open and transparent codebase, and
offering support to the community. The extensive and passionate community
surrounding CloudStack provides a safety net for operational concerns and
troubleshooting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

services in the short-term. Time-to-market when offering IT solutions, IaaS or
just provisioning infrastructure is a key factor for the company’s
competitiveness. This requires companies to utilize tools capable of providing
the agility to deliver new features, scalability, and infrastructure anywhere
almost instantly.</p><p><a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terraform</a> is an open-source infrastructure-as-code
tool created by Hashicorp and Licensed through the Apache 2 License. By using
Terraform, end users can easily create complex infrastructures anywhere, since
Terraform has a huge list of providers supported, including Apache CloudStack.</p><p>HashiCorp Terraform helps organizations improve productivity, reduce risk, and
increase business velocity as they integrate cloud into their IT environments.
According to them, it improves IT Ops productivity up to 75%.</p><h1>Apache CloudStack and Terraform Integration</h1><p>Terraform relies on a set of plugins known as Providers in order to provision or
manage resources and cloud services. As part of the integration of Terraform and
Apache CloudStack, Terraform requires a specific CloudStack provider, which acts
as a transition layer between Terraform and Apache CloudStack. This provider was
written to provision and manage resources such as virtual machines, networks,
templates, volumes etc., using the CloudStack APIs.</p><p>There are two main working components here:</p><ul><li>Terraform Core</li><li>CloudStack's Provider</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/terraform-1a484db84988e35f418015b5b39328df.png" title="CloudStack Terraform Integration" width="1384" height="406" class="img_ev3q"></p><a class="button button--primary" target="_blank" href="/files/terraform-solution-brief 2023.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE SOLUTION BRIEF</a><br><br><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/tamara-e08de353f7aeeacdb587cbc5e2769a18.png" title="Tamara" width="111" height="109" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p>“CloudStack and Terraform bring scalability and flexibility. The immediate
benefit out of them is that you can have tested and proven blueprints and roll
out environments quickly. Terraform is perfect for quickly creating Test/Dev
environments.</p><p>In distributed teams, collaboration is extremely important. Infrastructure as
code is a huge boost, helping teams to collaborate on code.”</p><p>-<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/muryshkin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tamara Muryshkin</a>, Enterprise Service Manager at Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft</p></blockquote><h1><a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About Terraform</a></h1><p>Terraform is an <strong>open-source infrastructure as code software tool</strong> that provides a
consistent CLI workflow to <strong>manage hundreds of cloud services</strong>. Terraform codifies
cloud APIs into declarative configuration files.</p><p>Terraform allows infrastructure to be expressed as code in a simple,
human-readable language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). It reads
configuration files and provides an execution plan of changes, which can be
reviewed for safety and then applied and provisioned. <strong>Extensible providers allow
Terraform to manage a broad range of resources, including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and
hardware services.</strong></p><a class="button button--primary" target="_blank" href="/files/terraform-solution-brief 2023.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE SOLUTION BRIEF</a><br>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Rohit Yadav]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/blog/meet-rohit-yadav-the-new"><img loading="lazy" alt="Rohit Yadav" src="/assets/images/header-79150c9f96db9e025aa858649bc15c73.jpg" title="Rohit Yadav - the new VP of Apache CloudStack" width="1200" height="628" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>The CloudStack Community is happy to announce Rohit Yadav as the new VP of the
Apache CloudStack Project and PMC chair. After a year of success in which Simon
Weller chaired the project, we are now excited to welcome Rohit, who is a
long-term contributor to the project. He has a strong technology background and
has been engaged in the open-source world for more than a decade, during which
he contributed to multiple other open-source projects.</p><p>In this interview, you will be able to learn more about Rohit Yadav and see his
perspective on the VP's role and how he can contribute to the Apache CloudStack
project evolution.</p><p><strong>Why do you believe in open-source, where and how did it all start?</strong></p><p>During my university days, I got introduced to open-source as a way of
community-driven development. Compared to proprietary and closed-source
software, I found the idea of open-source remarkable that anybody can access
source code, learn it, modify it, distribute it, and even contribute it back.</p><p>In my spare time, I started learning and contributing to a few open-source
projects as a hobby and even created some open-source side-projects. I also got
an opportunity to work with the VideoLAN project as a Google Summer of Code
student and later worked as a volunteer summer student at CERN.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Rohit Yadav" src="/assets/images/small-photo-9b8dbcd568888567ae8702a46fc25b15.jpg" title="Rohit Yadav" width="800" height="800" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>All of this early experience inculcated an interest in open-source and
virtualisation, and eventually, I was hired straight out of university by Citrix
to work on open-source Apache CloudStack project that was still in the ASF
incubator at the time. This is when I learned about the ASF and how to work in
the Apache CloudStack community from my colleagues and from the community, and I
learnt how to <a href="https://infra.apache.org/contributors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contribute changes</a>.
I started lurking and interacting on the project <a href="/mailing-lists">mailing lists</a>
and IRC to understand how to work in this community.</p><p>I quickly found myself supporting users on the mailing lists and learning
real-world use of CloudStack, contributing patches such as maintaining our (new)
maven-based build system, working on some issues and making some improvements. I
also wrote the <a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloudmonkey
CLI</a> because there wasn’t one
available and I also ended-up working on a large APIs refactoring project that
helped me understand CloudStack deeper and work closely with the original
creators and architects of CloudStack.</p><p>During this, I was invited to become a committer to the project and got
sponsored to participate in the first CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2012
in Las Vegas. After another few years of working on flagship CloudStack
features, frameworks, releases, maintaining CloudStack and collaborating with
the community, I eventually got invited to become a PMC member.</p><p>I’ve transitioned into a more supporting, mentoring, empowering and leadership
role in the community and at work. This allows me to find time and bandwidth to
champion and promote Apache CloudStack in all forums and platforms.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Rohit Yadav" src="/assets/images/photo-6ae7501c2355ae39108c9207ea491359.jpg" title="Rohit Yadav" width="4080" height="3072" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>Why should enterprises use open-source solutions?</strong></p><p>Enterprises nowadays are adopting open-source software especially when it comes
to infrastructure software. This gives them business advantage in keeping low
costs and not having to depend on a single vendor (no vendor lock-in) while have
the longevity, trust, stability, reliability, durability, flexibility, better
agility and security, and access to an ecosystem of community and commercial
offerings and support around it. There is also community and inter-organisation
collaborations on standards, frameworks and feature development that help reduce
costs for the end-consumers, including the enterprises.</p><p>Enterprises also attract better talent as it’s generally much easy to hire or
train talent on open-source software with its documentation and other types of
training materials in the form of books, blogs and videos etc., accessible to
everybody.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine any enterprise and any consumer product or service that
won’t have any open-source project used in their stacks.</p><p><strong>Who are the existing enterprise users of Apache CloudStack and how are they benefiting?</strong></p><p>Anybody looking to implement (private or public) IaaS cloud should seriously
consider CloudStack. It is easy to-use, cost-effective, very stable, massively
scalable, highly reliable battle-tested IaaS cloud computing platform,
well-known and used in production at many of the world’s largest organisations.
The project is community-driven by diverse contributors who are deeply invested
in solving real-world
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Case+Studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use-cases</a>.</p><p>You don’t have to take my word for it - as an open-source top-level
<a href="https://apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASF</a> project anybody can test drive and see it for
themselves, there is no vendor lock-in or paywall to get started. It takes a
very short amount of time and effort to set it up, perhaps a few hours or less
for a seasoned administrator. We have the <a href="https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/latest/quickinstallationguide/qig.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quick install
guides</a>
for anybody to get started and even a public simulator-based demo environment
for anybody with a few minutes to try it out, get the look-and-feel for it at
<a href="https://qa.cloudstack.cloud/simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://qa.cloudstack.cloud/simulator/</a> (using the demo-environment credentials
admin:password).</p><p>CloudStack is very easy to deploy, use and manage. Being a monolith application,
it’s easier to upgrade, can be managed by a small team. It is feature-rich, and
offers a great UI, APIs and rich tooling and libraries such as
<a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloudmonkey</a> (cmk, the
official CLI), the <a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-terraform-provider" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudStack Terraform
provider</a>, the
<a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-kubernetes-provider" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudStack Kubernetes
provider</a>, the
<a href="https://cluster-api-cloudstack.sigs.k8s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudStack Cluster-API Provider</a>
(CAPC), the <a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudStack Go-SDK</a>,
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_cloudstack.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support for
Ansible</a>,
and countless other integration, libraries and related projects in its
ever-growing ecosystem.</p><p>As an open-source project, Apache CloudStack project does not track who uses it.
Still, we have a fair idea of our user base based on the community-maintained
and contributed <a href="https://cloudstack.apache.org/users.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of users</a> on our
project website. Also, based on activities and representation by such users and
their organisations in the community by their participation on the mailing
lists, around releases, issue reporting and code contributions on GitHub,
attendance and participation in project meetups and conferences, and other
forums such as blogs, videos, websites, press releases, social media etc. These
enterprises, organisations and users include some of the world’s largest Fortune
500 companies.</p><p>I get super motivated and content when I read CloudStack
<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Case+Studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">case-studies</a>
or when I learn where and how our work on CloudStack benefits the core mission
of companies. In the most recent CloudStack Collab conference, I was delighted
to learn how CloudStack <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2LVY18GU8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">empowers the Digital India
mission</a> that helped <a href="https://www.cowin.gov.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vaccinate
billions</a> as well as delivers digital product and
services to citizens.</p><p><strong>How is Apache CloudStack project evolving and where do you see its future?</strong></p><p>Over the years, we’ve seen a steady stream of <a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer
contribution</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">releases</a>. We’re seeing
CloudStack getting more and more polished with every release. We’ve grown into a
pedigree of PMC members, committers, contributors and power users who have been
around in the community for a long time, a decade or more now. This demonstrates
the reliability, durability and stability the project offers to the users
community and the trust of the users community who are continuing to use and
support CloudStack over the years. We’re seeing CloudStack adoption growing
steadily from users participation on mailing lists, GitHub, meetups and
conferences and release adoption. Per the hype curve, we’re in the plateau of
productivity so this isn’t surprising.</p><p>We have always been a community-driven project and that should continue. We may
also see interesting integrations, features and other changes to align with the
changing themes and trends of the industry and the users community, we may find
such use-cases in AI, data sovereignty, privacy and cloud-repatriation.</p><p>We need to ensure there’s a healthy community that feels welcome to use
CloudStack, report issues, participate on the mailing lists and in meetups and
conferences, and tell us about their use-cases and problems in all such forums.</p><p>The users community should be supported to contribute to CloudStack, and <a href="https://github.com/shapeblue/hackerbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help
train</a> on CloudStack development, help
contribute fixes, enhancements and feature that solves their problems, and
invite them to become committers and PMC members of the project. As long we
support a healthy feedback loop and maintain the cycle of the project it will
continue to grow, evolve, and thrive. We also need more efforts towards project
marketing and promotion, and some work on strategic features, frameworks and
integrations that leads to more growth and adoption of CloudStack.</p><p><strong>Start contributing!</strong></p><p>Want to become a committer and join a great community? <a href="/contribute">Read on!</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

thought. With the right technology stack, companies can quickly and easily
deploy a flexible and stable IaaS offering to support any business requirements,
as proIO discovered.</p><p><a href="https://www.proio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proIO</a> was founded in Frankfurt, Germany, nearly 20 years ago, as Swen Brüseke
explains. “We wanted to create a company based on holistic IT concepts,
providing support and advice from system design and creation through to smooth
day-to-day running of operations.”, said Swen Brüseke, CEO of proIO.</p><p>The company started by remotely looking after its customer’s physical servers
and data centres in both Frankfurt and Hamburg - 24/7. This has grown to the
extent that they now support thousands of physical servers.</p><p>During the last few years, customer demand has led proIO to extend its support
services with a fully managed cloud offering to become a Managed Service
Provider specialising in open-source Linux applications.</p><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-case-study-proio2023.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY</a><h2>А Move to CloudStack</h2><p>The company migrated its cloud to CloudStack in 2019 for a number of reasons, as
Swen explained. “We had used it for several years on various other projects, and
so we had acquired a great amount of working knowledge. This experience
demonstrated to us how easy it was to set up a proof of concept and deploy a
CloudStack-based solution. It was also much easier to keep up to date once
deployed compared to other solutions we had looked at.</p><h2>Fully Redundant Infrastructure Based on Open-Source Technologies</h2><p>Currently, more than 95% of proIO’s virtual machines are Linux based. “Our
customers are not bothered whether their operating system is open source or
not,” explained Swen. “They just want their apps to run to support their
business. We now look after all types of customers from healthcare, hotel
booking, through automotive and clothing to publishing.</p><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-case-study-proio2023.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY</a><br><br><p>“It’s great the way that everybody helps each other out in the community,
contributing what they can to ensure CloudStack continues to develop and refine
as a product. I would recommend CloudStack wholeheartedly to any organisation
that is looking at developing a cloud-based infrastructure.”, says Swen Brüseke,
CEO of proIO.</p>]]></content:encoded>

of local experts provide highly standardized managed services to high-intent
customers to reach their full online potential. The group serves over 1 million
customers and generates €175m in revenue with its eight brands and 600
employees.</p><p>Your.Online needed to build a centralized IaaS cloud platform for four of their
brands - Versio, Yourhosting, Savvii and Axarnet. The four companies ran on
different infrastructure platforms using technologies like VMware, RHEV, Xen
server, Virtuozzo, Proxmox, custom-built solutions and many others. This made it
extremely hard and nearly impossible to manage their infrastructure centrally
and ensure reliability and operational effectiveness.</p><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-case-study-your-online.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY</a><h2>Building a Centralised Platform Based on CloudStack</h2><p>Your.Online has built a centralized platform powered by CloudStack, Ceph,
TrueNAS and KVM to be utilized by all their hosting brands. The new solution
allowed the company to simplify infrastructure management and have end-to-end
visibility of the processes inside from a single pane of glass.</p><p>Your.Online uses BGP, EVPN and VXLAN with CloudStack’s Advanced networking
model. This allows them to scale networks very easily in a redundant and
high-performant way over multiple data centers. This is a built-in functionality
of CloudStack, which when combined with IPv6 support and security groups makes
for a modern and future-proof solution, on which they can continue to invest and
grow.</p><h2>Ensuring Reliability in the Long Term</h2><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/85db8d29-cf32-409b-b3b2-1d23df9f598d" width="120px" class="img_ev3q">“One of the reasons to centralize on CloudStack is to have one single point of truth about the utilization of our assets. One overview of the VMs, assets and capacity utilization. Now we can automate against one platform, and for us, the main driver to choosing CloudStack was that it is an open-source project governed by the Apache Software Foundation. We know it is a stable platform both from a technical and legal perspective. The project will be live in the next ten years, allowing us to avoid the risk associated with commercial projects - usually licensing and governance problems.”<b>- Wido den Hollander, CTO, Your.Online</b><br><br><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-case-study-your-online.pdf">DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY</a><h2>About Your.Online</h2><p>Your.Online is a leading European online services platform supporting businesses

businesses succeed online. Their team consists of local experts providing highly
standardized managed services to high-intent customers to reach their full

climate-friendly data centers, use highly efficient hardware, continuous focus
on further optimization of their infrastructure, prolonging the use of servers
as much as possible and professionally recycling the ones that are no longer
functional. All these priorities create both business value and sustainable
impact.</p><h2>About Apache CloudStack</h2><p>Apache CloudStack is an open-source cloud management solution designed to deploy
and manage large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly
scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. CloudStack
is used by a number of service providers to offer public cloud services, and by
many companies to provide an on-premises (private) cloud offering, or as part of
a hybrid cloud solution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

You will be able to<strong>&nbsp;<!-- -->learn more about different software solutions, which can be combined with CloudStack</strong> and dive deep into specialized<!-- -->&nbsp;<strong>Technical Solution Briefs</strong>&nbsp;<!-- -->presenting the integrations.</p><p>Today we will introduce you to <a href="https://tungsten.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tungsten.</a></p><h1>Tungsten Fabric's Integration with Apache CloudStack</h1><p>Tungsten Fabric (TF) comprises components like controller and vRouter; plus additional components for analytics and third-party integration. In this Solution Brief, TF integrates with CloudStack as an SDN plugin to enable rich networking capabilities and lifecycle management of VMs and containers where TF components or control functions are deployed.</p><p>The deployment and life-cycle management of Tungsten Fabric can be done with tools like Ansible. After Tungsten Fabric and CloudStack are installed, we need to create a zone with the TF isolation method, and then, when we create a network or a vm in CloudStack, TF plugin will call the TF Controller API to create the resources.</p><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-tungsten-fabric-sdn.pdf"><b>DOWNLOAD THE SOLUTION BRIEF</b></a><br><br><strong>Key Outcomes for Users</strong><p>Apache CloudStack has long provided flexibility regarding network configuration to serve the needed use case. Along with built-in functionality, ACS has supported a number of different Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers, including VMware NSX multi-hypervisor (formally Nicara), Nuage and others.</p><p>However, Apache CloudStack lacked a fully-featured open-source SDN controller to deliver advanced networking features.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Apache CloudStack's integration with Tungsten Fabric will finally close this feature gap providing many long sought-after features, including BGP, MPLS, service stitching and deep security policy capabilities to meet even the most stringent industry requirements.</p><p>CloudStack will be able to manage these advanced functions via tight integration with the underlying best-of-breed network controller, while Tungsten Fabric handles the network fabric.&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>The Community Adopting the Integration of Apache CloudStack and Tungsten Fabric</strong></span></p><p>A number of community members have already adopted Tungsten Fabric as part of their cloud infrastructure. We reached out to the community to hear their thoughts on the integration and how it benefits their organisation.</p><p><em>‘’The EWERK Group mainly serves organizations in system-relevant industries with regulated IT. In these industries, highly complex IT infrastructure projects place special demands on the network. In order to meet these requirements, a future-oriented further development with the highest demand on technological know-how and flexibility of the software is needed. The support of Tungsten Fabric helps us to meet these requirements.’’</em></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Sven Vogel, Senior Manager R&amp;D for Cloud and Infrastructure - </strong><a href="https://www.ewerk.com/startseite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>EWERK</strong></a></p><p><em>"ENA is committed to the continued success of Apache CloudStack and we felt integrating Tungsten Fabric, a class leading open source Software Defined Networking (SDN) product addresses a key feature gap"</em>, remarked Simon Weller. <em>"ENA has been part of Apache CloudStack since its inception and we're proud that we're able to continue our work within the ACS community".</em></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Simon Weller, VP of Technology - </strong><a href="https://www.ena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Education Networks of America</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>About Tungsten Fabric</strong></p><p>Tungsten Fabric is an open-source network and security orchestrator which provides secure connectivity for cloud-native environments. Tungsten Fabric enables developers, network and security operations staff to deploy zero-trust micro-segmentation within a DevOps workflow to reduce the friction in application deployment. It ensures performance and security for deployments of tens of thousands of nodes at Tier 1 service providers, major research centers and enterprises with global operations.</p><p>With Tungsten Fabric, security and network engineers can build secure microservices that can be deployed on various container orchestration platforms, allowing them to work directly within the DevOps workflow. This ensures applications and infrastructure alike are secure against sophisticated attacks, while increasing development velocity and site reliability. Tungsten Fabric analytics provide flow-level visibility, while port mirroring provides application-level visibility.&nbsp;</p><p>Together these features enable network and security operations staff, streamlining troubleshooting and mean time to resolution (MTTR). Tungsten Fabric manages and implements physical and virtual networking and security for cloud environments. Since the same controller and forwarding components are used in every implementation, Tungsten Fabric provides a consistent interface for managing connectivity and policy in all the environments it supports, and can provide seamless and secure connectivity between workloads managed by different orchestrators, whether virtual machines or containers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

We collaborated on a successful major release - Apache CloudStack 4.17 bringing a bunch of new capabilities and improvements, as well as created multiple new CloudStack integrations. As well as this, the community created two minor releases as part of the LTS programme.</p><p>The community also held two successful conferences, one of which being the first in-person CloudStack Collaboration Conference since the pandemic. The new &amp;"Year in Review" blogs series encourages us to reflect on the community<!-- -->’<!-- -->s achievements, and thus lets us brainstorm the ways we will further develop Apache CloudStack in all facets in the new year. Find out what we managed to achieve together and what is coming in 2023 in this recap article!</p><span><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/what-s-new-in-apache1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><span>Apache CloudStack 4.17 Release</span></strong></a></span><p>The year saw the newest major release - Apache CloudStack 4.17, which brought a number of new and exciting features being introduced, including:</p><ul><li><span><span><strong><span>Zero Downtime Upgrades for Virtual Routers</span></strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>With this new feature, the virtual router does not have to go through the process of complete removal and instantiating a new one involving shutdown, resource release, system VM template copy from secondary storage to primary, starting and VR configuration</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Previously when a new release of Apache CloudStack was deployed, the operations team had to organize maintenance windows to allow the redeployment of every virtual router. Now an in-place upgrade of CloudStack virtual routers can be performed with zero downtime.</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong><span>VR Live Patching</span></strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>Underpinning zero downtime upgrades is the new feature VR live patching. This feature can also be used independently of upgrades and allow CloudStack admins to apply software updates to Virtual Routers on the fly. Previously all Apache CloudStack scripts to manage the Virtual Router were stored in an ISO image and mounted during the first boot and then copied to the Virtual Router. Now the update is performed dynamically , as long as the base OS remains constant , users to not need to recreate the Virtual Router.</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><strong><span><span>IPv6 support for Isolated and VPC Networks</span></span></strong></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>IPv6 is considered a natural evolution of any system that intends to be present in computing environments in the future. The RIPE NCC, which assigns IP addresses in 76 countries to ISPs and other organizations, got its final allocation of IPv4 addresses from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in 2012.</span></span></span><br><span><span><span>Apache CloudStack already supported IPv6 for Shared Networks; now IPv6 is also supported for Isolated Networks and VPC. Users can deploy IPv6 networks where routing is currently static, allowing users to use subnets of IPv6 networks directly in CloudStack instances.</span><br><span>In this context, unlike IPv4 that relies on NAT to deliver network services to users, the Virtual Router behaves like a real router, routing IPv6 packets and allowing users to configure firewall.</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><strong><span><span>Self-service Network Improvements</span></span></strong></span></li></ul><p><span><span>Previously, the creation of Shared Networks and Private Gateways was an admin- only feature. When a user needed a Shared Network or Private Gateway, they would have to make a service request to the Service Provider or infrastructure operations team. Only after that, users could configure and use their respective resources.</span></span></p><p><span><span>With Apache CloudStack 4.17, users can self-serve the creation of these resources through the UI or API with no involvement of the admin.</span></span></p><p><strong><span><span>To learn more about the remaining features introduced in the 4.17 release, read the </span><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/what-s-new-in-apache1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>release blog.</span></a></span></strong></p><p><strong><span><u><span><span>New CloudStack Integrations</span></span></u></span></strong></p><p><span><span>The community has collaborated on a new blog series named ‘CloudStack Integrations’, introducing a range of technologies with which CloudStack is integrated with and can become part of your technology stack. You will be able to learn more about different software solutions, which can be combined with CloudStack and dive deep into specialized Technical Solution Briefs presenting the integrations.</span></span></p><ul><li><span><strong>Kubernetes CAPI Provider - CloudStack Integration</strong></span></li></ul><p><span><span>The Kubernetes Cluster API (CAPI) provider for Apache CloudStack allows Kubernetes users to build and manage resources on Apache CloudStack. The Cluster API brings declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and management. The API itself is shared across multiple cloud providers allowing for true Apache CloudStack hybrid deployments of Kubernetes. It is built atop the lessons learned from previous cluster managers such as kops and kubicorn.</span></span></p><p><span><span>If users want to launch a Kubernetes cluster on Apache CloudStack, they can check out the </span><a href="https://cluster-api-cloudstack.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Started Guide</a><span> to create your first Kubernetes cluster on Apache CloudStack using Cluster API.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Watch the session below from the CloudStack European User Group this year, featuring Peter Motykowski from AWS discuss more about the newly developed provider, its capabilities and how you can benefit from it!</span></span></p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuXdsDjPq9E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/ce27ebce-d019-41d6-b105-c2827751a678" alt="kubernetes CAPI.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><ul><li><span><a href="https://storpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>StorPool Storage</strong></a><strong><span> - CloudStack Integration</span></strong></span></li></ul><p><span><span>StorPool Storage volume management is integrated now with Apache CloudStack to allow seamless use of the capabilities of the StorPool Storage system through the CloudStack GUI, CLI, and API interfaces. With the integration, the features available in StorPool get inherited by each cloud deployed with StorPool Storage - enabling cloned provisioning, instant snapshots, thin provisioning, and backup, disaster recovery, and Quality of Service (QoS) policies per virtual disk or virtual machine (VM). Thanks to the way StorPool works, VM provisioning is nearly instantaneous, and data placement policies and other settings can be changed in-flight to address changes in user requirements. </span><a href="/img/imported/5e069f87-a428-4f07-92ac-a8bf8d0d114b?api=v2">Click here</a><span> to download the solution brief. </span></span></p><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2022-roundup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><span>CloudStack Collaboration Conference</span></strong></a><p><span><span>The community re-joined in-person for the first time since the pandemic, at the CloudStack Collaboration Conference in Sofia last month.&nbsp; The hybrid event hosted over 370 participants and 48 speakers from 32 countries! The conference broke its record for the most in-person attendees. In total, there were 38 sessions from leading CloudStack experts, users and skilful engineers from the open-source world. These sessions included: technical talks, user stories, new features and integrations presentations and more. You can watch back the sessions or retrieve the slides on the </span><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2022-roundup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">event roundup blog.</a><span> Do keep in mind the sessions are still being released, so make sure you subscribe to the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ApacheCloudStack/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache CloudStack YouTube channel</a><span> and turn on bell notifications.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/cloudstack-european-user-group-virtual" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><span>CloudStack European User Group</span></strong></a></span></p><p><span><span>Taking place on April 7th, 2022, The CloudStack European User Group was a virtual get together for the European CloudStack Community, hosting 260+ attendees from 25 countries. The event hosted a total of 10 sessions, all of which you can watch back on the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnIKk7GjgFlYfut3ZIOrvN--_YuSPIerQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache CloudStack YouTube channel</a><span>. Just like CCC, it was great to see new CloudStack committers and users, showing the growth of the global community.&nbsp; </span></span></p><p><u><span><strong><span><span>Looking to the Future - Apache CloudStack 4.18 Release</span></span></strong></span></u></p><p><span>The community is looking forward to the upcoming 4.18 release, expected in late January 2023. Some exciting features you will be able to find in the new release are: </span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong>Edge computing (4.18)&nbsp;</strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the data source and end consumer. The presence of computing capabilities at the edge of the network reduces response times for applications while reducing connectivity costs.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>This new feature will enable</span><span> operators to leverage CloudStack in deploying light-weight Zones in edge locations. Compared to the traditional CloudStack zones, a dehydrated zone results in resource savings on the boards - solving problems related to latency at low cost in regions poorly served by the internet network.</span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong>Tungsten SDN Fabric (4.18)</strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>Tungsten Fabric is an open-source SDN project that solves tooling complexity with the simplicity of only one networking and security tool. It is maintained by The Linux Foundation and is designed to support any cloud anywhere.&nbsp; </span></span></p><p><span><span>From 4.18, Apache CloudStack users can leverage Tungsten Fabric as a Network Provider in Isolated and VPC Networks, adding this widely adopted SDN fabric to fill feature gaps in CloudStack, enhancing security and capabilities.</span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong>Autoscaling (4.18)</strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>This feature is an Apache CloudStack native solution, different from other approaches that created vendor lock-in of closed source products. From Apache CloudStack 4.18, cloud users can configure Autoscale VM Groups to dynamically scale up and down the number of Instances when the defined trigger conditions are met. </span></span></p><p><span><span>… and a lot more new capabilities, which will enable cloud operators to achieve more and manage easier their virtualisation. </span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong><u><span><span>At the end of the year…</span></span></u></strong></span></p><p><span>It was great to see another year of expansion of the Apache CloudStack community. We are happy to see new companies around the world adopting the technology and becoming involved in the community, whether it is through collaborations, development or keeping active on the mailing lists. In order for an open-source project to develop and be successful, people need to give back to the project - something that the Apache CloudStack community does extremely well. We are very grateful to the community’s efforts and progression in the technology, so kudos to all involved!&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>New use cases are being shared, such as <a href="https://www.arsat.com.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARSAT</a> covering their use cases regarding cloud services in Argentinian government entities and also sharing their mid-term roadmap strategy to include the private sector in Arsat´s client portfolio. Another thing worth reflecting on is how companies who have been adopting Apache CloudStack long-term have managed to build reliable solutions and are using the technology continuously without looking for alternatives. The reason being because CloudStack is constantly expanding its supported integrations and technologies landscape, plus the amazing pace of development and new features released. Last but not least, we also see more vendors interested in both adopting CloudStack or building new solutions on top of it like <a href="https://www.apiculus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apiculus</a> and <a href="https://www.stackbill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackBill</a> for example. </span></p><p><span>We would like to say a big thank you to everyone involved in the project and look forward to collaborating at the CloudStack European User Group in May!</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

While CloudStack handles the technical orchestration (of Compute, Storage and Networking resources), Apiculus complements that by adding layers of billing, marketing, monitoring, support and unified marketplace capabilities.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“The simplicity of setting up and managing complex network architectures, along with a community that’s deeply invested in solving real-world use cases, are what, I believe, set CloudStack apart from other orchestration platforms.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you?&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>“I see CloudStack as serving two different niches in the near future. One, as enterprises are bringing their workloads ‘back’ to their premises, CloudStack is going to play a key role, as owning and managing a CloudStack setup is much more efficient (w.r.t. manpower, costs, complexity) than other orchestrators. Two, as the future is going closer and closer to the end user (Edge, Web3 etc.), the portability of CloudStack makes it an ideal candidate to embrace cloud-native and Edge-native technologies to deliver powerful orchestration capabilities nearer to the end users.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, </strong><a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ShapeBlue</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Giles is the CEO and founder of ShapeBlue.

Most organisations are using CloudStack to drive either public cloud implementation or to orchestrate internally within an enterprise. As ShapeBlue is the company that provides services around CloudStack, we see our role as representing those customers in the open-source project. Secondary to that, we do use CloudStack in our own internal CI/CD environment, but that is a relatively small scale compared to most people using CloudStack.”&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“Against other IaaS orchestration platforms, CloudStack has got two key advantages: A) Ease of deployment - whereas a lot of other platforms are incredibly complex to deploy. B) Reliability - CloudStack has been around for over a decade, it’s very stable, it’s very well-known, it’s in production use at many of the world’s largest organisations.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you?&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>“CloudStack’s scope will remain tightly defined. CloudStack does not have aspirations to become a new block storage platform or to become a container orchestrator, it’s highly defined at the level, which is the virtualised based orchestration layer. CloudStack will become increasingly reliable, increasingly easy to deploy, and effectively we hope will just become boring.”</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span><strong>Philipp Reisner, CEO, </strong><a href="https://linbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>LINBIT</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Philipp Reisner is one of the founders and CEO of LINBIT.

As CloudStack, it is OpenSource software composed out of DRBD, LINSTOR, and LVM/ZFS.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“As LINBIT's SDS is available for multiple cloud software stacks and enterprise virtualization stacks, we have a bit of insight into multiple communities. The CloudStack community is thriving, and we see that CloudStack is heavily adopted in mid-sized deployments.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you?&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>“I expect CloudStack will find more large-scale adopters as the hype around the big competing technology cools off.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Grégoire Lamodière, Founder, </strong><a href="https://cloud.dimsi.io/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>DIMSI</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Grégoire Lamodière is the Co-founder of DIMSI.&nbsp;Grégoire is a software architect who spends most of his time designing infrastructure applications and CRM systems, on-premise or multi-cloud based.

It consists of two well-concerted components. LINSTOR and DRBD. Each of them also has its independent use cases, where it is deployed alone. In this presentation, the combination of these two is examined. They form the control plane and the data plane of the SDS. We will touch on: Performance, scalability, hyper-convergence (data-locality for high IO performance), resiliency through data replication (synchronous within a site, 2-way, 3-way, or more), snapshots, backup (to S3), encryption at rest, deduplication, compression, placement policies (regarding failure domains), management CLI and webGUI, monitoring interface, self-healing (restoring redundancy after device/node failure), the federation of multiple sites (async mirroring and repeatedly snapshot difference shipping), QoS control (noisy neighbors limitation) and of course: complete integration with CloudStack for KVM guests. It is Open Source software following the Unix philosophy. Each component solves one task, made for maximal re-usability. The solution leverages the Linux kernel, LVM and/or ZFS, and many Open Source software libraries. Building on these giant Open Source foundations, not only saves LINBIT from re-inventing the wheels, it also empowers your day 2 operation teams since they are already familiar with these technologies.</div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEWjocVhzno&amp;list=PLnIKk7GjgFlYcKNbhYSgWGbJ8nJ0g496V&amp;index=22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/3a720046-c093-4636-83bb-e48f4f64da92" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 11.41.03.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/a81uXODtt3KItT" width="854" height="712" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> </iframe><div><strong>About Phillip Reisner:</strong></div><div>Philipp Reisner is one of the founders and CEO of LINBIT in Vienna/Austria.

With the help of Stack Console’s reseller management module and CloudStack, a data center or cloud service provider can build resellers/partners and provide them with an automated white-label cloud management platform so they can sell cloud services under their own brand, such as compute, Kubernetes, load balancer, block storage, and so on. Many of resellers are likely to be small and medium-sized businesses that want to get into the cloud market, so this is great news for them. Service providers will still make money whether a customer buys a service directly from them or through one of their resellers.</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_nhzY3-QZs&amp;list=PLnIKk7GjgFlYcKNbhYSgWGbJ8nJ0g496V&amp;index=24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/6b18b8d7-3faf-4f2d-87cc-2ea5686f305e" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 11.46.25.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/hLfHYS9nzHSnt9" width="854" height="712" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> </iframe><div><strong>About Saurabh Rapatwar:</strong></div><div>Saurabh is a leader, an innovator, and a technology pioneer with more than 13 years of experience in the SaaS, IaaS, and technology domains.

You will be able to learn more about different software solutions, which can be combined with CloudStack and dive deep into specialized Technical Solution Briefs presenting the integrations.<br>Today we will meet you with <a href="https://storpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StorPool Storage</a>.</p><p>Cloud builders worldwide - Managed Services Providers, Hosting Services Providers, Cloud Services Providers, Enterprises, and SaaS Vendors - are always seeking ways to optimize the architecture and cost of their public and private cloud deployments. With Apache CloudStack and StorPool Storage, they can deploy a highly automated cloud that delivers the application performance and reliability their users need while easily addressing changes in user requirements over the long term.</p><p>The new Solution Brief developed by the Apache CloudStack Community and StorPool aids cloud and storage architects, consultants, administrators, and field practitioners in the design and deployment of reliable, easy-to-manage, and cost-efficient cloud infrastructure based on Apache CloudStack working with KVM hosts and StorPool Storage.</p><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-solution-brief-storpool-2022.pdf"><b>DOWNLOAD THE SOLUTION BRIEF</b></a><br><h2><strong>StorPool’s Integration with Apache CloudStack</strong></h2><p>StorPool Storage volume management is integrated with <a href="https://storpool.com/cloudstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache CloudStack</a> to allow seamless use of the capabilities of the StorPool Storage system through the CloudStack GUI, CLI, and API interfaces. With the integration, the features available in StorPool get inherited by each cloud deployed with StorPool Storage - enabling cloned provisioning, instant snapshots, thin provisioning, and backup, disaster recovery, and Quality of Service (QoS) policies per virtual disk or virtual machine (VM). Thanks to the way StorPool works, VM provisioning is nearly instantaneous, and data placement policies and other settings can be changed in-flight to address changes in user requirements.</p><h2><strong>Benefits of a Joint Deployment with CloudStack and StorPool Storage</strong></h2><p>The integration between Apache CloudStack and StorPool Storage results in several business and technical benefits.</p><h4>Business Benefits:</h4>• Always online <br>• End-to-end automation<br>• Operational flexibility <br>• Component interoperability<br>• Effective hardware lifecycle management<h4>Technical Benefits:</h4><p>• Simplified operations <br>• Faster deployment with reduced technological risk and shorter time to market <br>• Reduced outages caused by human errors<br>• Shared continuous storage space for all hosts in a zone<br>• Independent scaling of the compute and storage resources<br>• Fast live migration of VMs from any to any host without data movement<br>• Resilience to hardware failures as data integrity is maintained upon failure of a drive, storage node, host, or even an entire pod.<br>• All storage operations are automated, eliminating storage administration tasks like volume management, capacity management, etc.</p><h2><strong>About StorPool Storage</strong></h2><p>StorPool Storage is a primary storage platform designed to be the ideal foundation for high-performance public and private clouds. It is the easiest way to convert sets of commercial off-the-shelf servers with standard storage drives and network devices into high-performance, linearly scalable primary storage systems.<br>StorPool Storage systems are ideal for storing and managing the data of workloads that demand extreme reliability and low latency - databases, web servers, virtual desktops, real-time analytics, and other mission-critical software. Compared to traditional SANs, all-flash arrays, or other storage software, StorPool Storage is faster, more reliable, and scalable due to its distributed architecture. StorPool is designed from the ground up to provide cloud builders with the fastest and most resource-efficient storage software on the market.</p><a class="button button--primary button--lg" target="_blank" href="/files/acs-solution-brief-storpool-2022.pdf"><b>DOWNLOAD THE SOLUTION BRIEF</b></a>]]></content:encoded>

I am based out of Delhi, India and am passionate about travelling and dig going on driving holidays with my friends and family. I love listening to music and ABBA has been my all-time favourite band since childhood.</p><p><strong>Tell us your story in one Tweet?</strong></p><p>As a commerce graduate, moving to an IT career accidentally was probably the best thing that happened to me. I subsequently completed my masters in software engineering and worked as a developer with different ISPs where my interest in infrastructure programming was kindled.</p><p><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>My first exposure to CloudStack was in 2013 and since then I have embarked on a very exciting journey where I have evolved from a CloudStack user to an evangelist. I love tinkering on CloudStack and the techno-commercial possibilities it offers to the regional Internet, Cloud and Data Center providers.</p><p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>I have received a lot of help from the community. If I must take a single name, it would be Rohit Yadav. He has been my mentor and will probably remain so for a while as far as CloudStack is concerned. During my initial days, folks from Citrix helped me a lot too, Vimmy Hong for one.</p><p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong></p><p>My commitment to CloudStack has been indirect but impacting. It has been taking it to the industry - the enterprises, telecoms, ISPs and data centre providers and showcasing how CloudStack can be leveraged as a viable cloud business model and implementing the same across various geographies. My organisation’s product offering is completely architected by leveraging CloudStack and transforming it into a techno-commercial solution.</p><p>On the technical side, I have worked extensively on various aspects of monitoring CloudStack and shared the same amongst the community. I am currently looking to implement an outside-in way of monitoring VRs and providing auto-scale facilities without modifying the CloudStack code.</p><p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong></p><p>It’s cost-effective, allows unmatched customising flexibility and it works! It’s that simple. Since it’s community-driven, it is always balanced. The collective intelligence of the community is always greater than the sum of each individual’s intelligence.</p><p>Many pairs of eyes mean tighter, more secure, more relevant and more efficient code. Your choice to pay for support is completely de-linked from the licence to use the product. What’s more, there are a plethora of licences to choose from to leverage the same in your own product/service offering.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Follow him on Twitter:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/kbshivkumar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="https://twitter.com/kbshivkumar">https://twitter.com/kbshivkumar</a></p><p><strong>Connect with him on LinkedIn:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/kbshiv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="https://in.linkedin.com/in/kbshiv">https://in.linkedin.com/in/kbshiv</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 14th June 2022, a new issue affecting only KVM users using Shared Mount Point storage was reported [1]. This issue affects the creation and the usage of existing Shared Mount Point storage pools on Apache CloudStack 4.17.0.0.<br></p><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17.0.0 added support for the StorPool storage based on Shared Mount Point. However, the current version of CloudStack doesn<!-- -->'<!-- -->t allow multiple implementations of Shared Mount Point storage pool providers, causing the StorPool provider to override the default implementation. This affected the other storage pool providers for Shared Mount Point since CloudStack tries to add them as a StorPool storage pool.<br></p><p>To mitigate the issue, a CloudStack administrator needs to do the following on version 4.17.0.0:<br></p><ul><li>On each management server: stop the CloudStack management service, remove the Storpool plugin jar on /usr/share/cloudstack-management/lib/cloud-plugin-storage-volume-storpool-4.17.0.0.jar and restart the CloudStack management service<br></li><li>On each KVM host: stop the CloudStack agent service, remove the StorPool plugin jar on /usr/share/cloudstack-agent/lib/cloud-plugin-storage-volume-storpool-4.17.0.0.jar and restart the CloudStack agent service<br></li></ul><p>Note: This workaround removes the StorPool plugin support. StorPool users should not apply the workaround to continue using their Storpool storage.<br></p><p>This issue will be fixed in the upcoming CloudStack version 4.17.1.0.<br></p><p>[1]<!-- -->&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/6455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/6455"></a><a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/6455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/6455</a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 is the latest release of the cloud management platform from the Apache Software Foundation and is a result of months of work from the development community. Apache CloudStack 4.17 is an LTS (Long Term Support) release so will be maintained for a period of 18 months after release.</p><p>As always, the release contains a myriad of small improvements and bug fixes but here we focus on the major new functionality of the release.</p><p><strong>VR Zero Downtime upgrades and Live Patching</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/bc49a766-6b83-4e9c-b4f9-a233a176699f"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/bc49a766-6b83-4e9c-b4f9-a233a176699f" alt="0.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>This is one of the most anticipated improvements by existing Apache CloudStack operators. CloudStack has always been easier to upgrade than many of its competitors but has required its virtual routers to be redeployed during an upgrade.</p><p><strong>o Zero Downtime Upgrades for Virtual Routers</strong><br>With this new feature, the virtual router does not have to go through the process of complete removal and instantiating a new one involving shutdown, resource release, system VM template copy from secondary storage to primary, starting and VR configuration<br>Previously when a new release of Apache CloudStack was deployed, the operations team had to organize maintenance windows to allow the redeployment of every virtual router. Now an in-place upgrade of CloudStack virtual routers can be performed with zero downtime.<br></p><p><strong>o VR Live Patching</strong><br>Underpinning zero downtime upgrades is the new feature VR live patching. This feature can also be used independently of upgrades and allow CloudStack admins to apply software updates to Virtual Routers on the fly. Previously all Apache CloudStack scripts to manage the Virtual Router were stored in an ISO image and mounted during the first boot and then copied to the Virtual Router. Now the update is performed dynamically , as long as the base OS remains constant , users to not need to recreate the Virtual Router.</p><p><strong>IPv6 support for Isolated and VPC Networks</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/919e55f8-b723-4680-b538-f9afc2ce0e01"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/919e55f8-b723-4680-b538-f9afc2ce0e01" alt="2.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>IPv6 is considered a natural evolution of any system that intends to be present in computing environments in the future. The RIPE NCC, which assigns IP addresses in 76 countries to ISPs and other organizations, got its final allocation of IPv4 addresses from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in 2012.<br>Apache CloudStack already supported IPv6 for Shared Networks; now IPv6 is also supported for Isolated Networks and VPC. Users can deploy IPv6 networks where routing is currently static, allowing users to use subnets of IPv6 networks directly in CloudStack instances.<br>In this context, unlike IPv4 that relies on NAT to deliver network services to users, the Virtual Router behaves like a real router, routing IPv6 packets and allowing users to configure firewall.</p><p><strong>StorPool Storage Plugin</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/c15f95e5-3b77-4bc5-b518-dc42ca867041"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/c15f95e5-3b77-4bc5-b518-dc42ca867041" alt="3.png" width="710" height="456" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>StorPool is a software defined storage platform in use by many CloudStack operators globally. StorPool has had “managed storage” integration with CloudStack for some time but now the StorPool Storage plug-in is natively included with Apache CloudStack. Thanks to the built-in automation of the plug-in, cloud builders can seamlessly manage their cloud from CloudStack’s familiar user interfaces, and all storage-related operations are transparently passed down to the underlying StorPool primary storage system.</p><p>With the Storpool plug-in, the features available in StorPool get inherited by each cloud-deployed - enabling cloned provisioning, instant snapshots, thin provisioning, backup/DR and QoS policies per virtual disk and/or per Instance. Instance provisioning is nearly instantaneous and data placement policies and other settings can be changed in-flight to address changes in user requirements.</p><p><strong>Self-service Network Improvements</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/417bd9d1-ba39-4904-b56b-bcf226dab4ff"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/417bd9d1-ba39-4904-b56b-bcf226dab4ff" alt="4.png" width="668" height="575" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Previously, the creation of Shared Networks and Private Gateways was an admin- only feature. When a user needed a Shared Network or Private Gateway, they would have to make a service request to the Service Provider or infrastructure operations team. Only after that, users could configure and use their respective resources.</p><p>With Apache CloudStack 4.17, users can self-serve the creation of these resources through the UI or API with no involvement of the admin.</p><p><strong>Multi-account Network Access</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/6c540c73-9951-4cb7-8a4c-7fdf1b25a000"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/6c540c73-9951-4cb7-8a4c-7fdf1b25a000" alt="5.png" width="750" height="242" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>In Apache CloudStack, users are organized into a logical structure of Accounts and Domains. In previous version of Apache CloudStack, the resources of each Account weren’t shared, and each Account had its own resources. As an example, sometimes​​​​​​ a particular software application from a specific Account needed to access an application in another account under the same Domain. For this to be feasible, users configured their networks with the firewall rules, port forwarding, load balancing or private gateway to allow this type of use case. In addition, this configuration caused a lot of network overhead as all packets had to go through 2 different Virtual Routers to reach their destination.</p><p>With Apache CloudStack 4.17, users can connect their instances by adding a new network interface from an Account under the same Domain, simplifying this kind of use case. Furthermore, if the communication between instances occurs only at OSI layer 2, several overheads are removed, considering that the I/O packets will be established between the instances directly in the same network layer to which they are connected.</p><p><strong>Multiple SSH Keys</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/6242bd8e-d5ad-4027-aed4-3dd576a58199"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/6242bd8e-d5ad-4027-aed4-3dd576a58199" alt="6.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>CloudStack users can now create Instances and include multiple SSH Keys. This avoids the need to share private keys between users that access the Instance.</p><p>Previously, if users needed to add more SSH Keys to access the instance, it was necessary to connect to the instance and then edit the .ssh/authorized_keys file, however now all the keys needed can be selected during the instance creation itself.</p><p><strong>Structured System Events</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/69265134-a914-48d2-8af0-70cb5d8d0828"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/69265134-a914-48d2-8af0-70cb5d8d0828" alt="Untitled design.png" width="750" height="647" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 brings much more structure to its system Events. Auditability and traceability of operations performed are important requirements for most organisations.</p><p>CloudStack Events are the primary data-source for auditing and troubleshooting a CloudStack environment. Events have now been improved by being explicitly linking to the resource that the event concerns. This allows Events to be searched, filtered and sorted by object.</p><p>Navigation is also improved, allowing users to navigate easily to the events for a specific object i.e. Instance, Network, Host</p><p>Many CloudStack operators had previously parsed the Event messages to store them in a 3rd party data source. The messages remain unchanged to allow backwards compatibility of such integrations.</p><p><strong>Snapshot improvements</strong></p><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 introduces storage-based snapshots - an alternative for taking snapshots of virtual machines running under the KVM hypervisor. The current implementation uses libvirt to perform the snapshot and doesn’t allow storage providers that keep VM virtual disks in RAW format (e.g., Ceph/NetApp SolidFire/LINSTOR/StorPool Storage) to take VM snapshots.</p><p>The storage-based snapshots feature provides for such storage systems the functionality to take crash-consistent snapshots of any VM’s virtual disks without the memory. The feature relies on each underlying storage plug-in’s capability to create/revert/delete virtual disk snapshots.</p><p><strong>Instance and Volumes migration improvements</strong></p><p>Apache CloudStack allows admins to migrate Instances and volumes using a wizard. Previously this wizard would automatically allocate Primary Storage for Instance Volumes based solely on storage tags. CloudStack 4.17 now allows the admin to explicitly allocate each Instance Volume to different specific Primary Storages.</p><p>In addition, to make more informed decisions while selecting destination host and storage, additional information is presented in the UI such as the occupancy of existing capacity of these resources, which brings a significant improvement in migration functionality.</p><p><strong>More flexible service offerings</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/7d34a18b-a0d9-4da5-8ffe-bfb66496aaf3"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/7d34a18b-a0d9-4da5-8ffe-bfb66496aaf3" alt="9.png" width="750" height="596" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 redefines the relationship between the Service Offerings used for Instance Root Disks and the Service Offering for the Instance itself.</p><p>Instance Root Volumes were previously handled decoupled from Disk Offerings: a change of the Root Volume characteristics wasn’t possible due to this logical disconnection. Thus, users couldn’t, for example, change to a Disk Offering that guaranteed higher I/O needs if necessary. So, there were two types of resources, Root volume and Data volume, but the treatment used in both was not unified.</p><p>The existing model is still fully supported if required, but this improvement gives operators far greater flexibility when it comes to the provisioning and billing for root volumes.</p><p><strong>Server Status Report</strong>Apache CloudStack 4.17 now gives admins the ability to see the status/health of their Management Servers, the Usage Server, and the underlying database server (and their respective individual components). This feature is available in the UI and API for integration/monitoring purposes.</p><p><strong>KVM multiple local storage</strong></p><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 now supports multiple local storage volumes for KVM based Hosts. Previously, for KVM hosts, it was only possible to have one primary local storage, which prevented providers from adding extra disks to be offered on CloudStack.</p><p>With this improvement, if more than one local disk on the KVM host is available, it is possible to designate them to be offered as a local disk offering , thus enabling a better use of allocated resources.</p><p><strong>Reserve and release Public IPs</strong>Users can now reserve public IPs for later use on their networks. This new functionality makes managing this feature easier, as users often need to have IP information available beforehand to parameterize DNS records, for example.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Simon has been an Apache CloudStack PMC member for the last few years. He has a strong technology background in multiple competencies, including networking and systems. In addition to it, he has a significant business development background with both start-ups and established organizations and is a highly experienced strategic thinker and relationship builder.</p><p>Currently, Simon Weller is the Vice President Of Technology of Education Networks of America. He is responsible for the technology initiatives at ENA across the Systems, R&amp;D, Internal Systems and Data Architecture and Business Intelligence teams. Simon is also heavily involved in product development and business development.</p><p>Ivet Petrova, Marketing Director at ShapeBlue interviewed Simon as part of the Meet the Community Series. You can watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sVYGehxsn0&amp;t=332s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Below, you can find some of the key point’s Simon laid out in the video.</p><p><strong>Тhe </strong><strong>Evolution of Apache CloudStack: </strong><strong>Continue the community vision and drive forward</strong></p><p>‘I think that every project that gets accepted under the Apache umbrella always has to try and build that really important base of community, because without that community, you can't survive. We see a lot of projects that have got a lot of excitement and they just fade away. I think what's been really great about CloudStack over the years is that we've managed to really continue that community vision and we've got a really great core group of people that have been around a long time that still have that passion and want to encourage others to participate as well. But the most important thing of open source is, you have to get others to want to contribute and you have to get others to want to give up some of their time and effort in order to make sure that you don't just survive, but that you can actually drive forward a project into the future and make it sustainable.’</p><p><strong>The Everyday Problems Open-source Solutions Solve: Building a Long-term sustainability</strong></p><p>‘Part of what I've done since I started in technology has always been trying to leverage the best technology and the best open-source solutions that we can. But I think one thing that is often missed by a lot of enterprise environments and organisations is that they think that they can just take and just walk away. But the most important thing to sustainability long term is you have to be able to give back as well. So, part of what my mission has always been working at open source for a long time, is making sure that when we do talk to others and we encourage them to try the technology out and hopefully implement it into production, but also think about how are they going to give back long term so that the product and the project is sustainable.’</p><p><strong>The Secret of a Successful Open-source Community: Engagement in all areas</strong></p><p>‘I think it's a bit of a misnomer that a lot of people have that you have to be a developer in order to be able to give back to open-source. So, I'm not a great developer, I dabble a little bit, but I'm not going to claim that I'm the best developer suited for any particular environmental project. Where I come in personally is I really try and give back to the user base from an engineering perspective. You've got a problem -how do we help you fix it? You want to implement a potential way of doing things - how can we encourage others to collaborate on it together? So, I think that a lot of people need to get out of that mindset, that you've got to be a coder in order to be able to give back to open source. There are so many other areas that you can contribute. I mean, case in point Ivet, you're fantastic at what you do, but you're not a developer, right? But you are encouraging others through your engagement practises, through organising events, through promoting the project overall to the community. And that is just as important, if not more so than ever writing a line of code. So I think that a lot of people need to start to maybe think about other areas that they can contribute outside of just writing a line of code, because a project doesn't survive long term unless you have that marketing capability, unless you have the outreach and you're able to encourage new participants because ultimately you're always going to have some people leaving the community and you need a long, robust pipeline of new members coming in to help out as well.’</p><p><strong>Implementing CloudStack: Scalability, simplicity and reliability</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>‘I think that what draws a lot of people to CloudStack is the fact that it supports a lot of different technologies. And a lot of companies at some point get to a realisation that they have to scale their environment. And doing that with a lot of the other products on the market with a commercial open source can be quite challenging. And case in point, we've seen a lot of folks over the years that have started off with VMware or they might have started off with a public cloud solution like AWS or Azure or Google Cloud. They get to a point and then they figure out, well, how are we going to scale this? And let me explain what I mean by that, because a lot of people right now are saying, well, of course, you can scale AWS or Azure or Google Cloud, you can, but at a massive cost. So, scaling comes in to both how to make money long term if you're a commercial entity. And how to minimise those costs, how do you make it more manageable and how do you get to that next level? So, I think a lot of entities that start looking at that solution, such as Apache CloudStack, I think in not just about the pure technology play, but their thinking about the viability of the product long-term. Typically, what we see is that as new companies get started, or even established companies get started, they see a higher margin opportunity on the front end, and over time that starts to get a bit more commoditized. They're looking for areas of savings in the underlying technology, and I think that's where a lot of people start to look at CloudStack. I think also you see other people and other companies that have been at open-source for a long time. And they might have deployed KVM or some other hypervisor technology. And they just get to that technological point where they can no longer scale managing manually 100 hosts or something like that. And so, they start to look for orchestration methods to make their life easier. And that's really where CloudStack shines.’</p><p><strong>The Benefits of Open-source Technology: Much more than cost-savings</strong></p><p>‘The number one thing that I always think about is flexibility. And the ability for you to take something that has already been built out and then add new capabilities to it, to meet the mission of your organisation's goals. For example, we've contributed a lot of new features to CloudStack over the years that have been driven by customer demands. And that's the best way to build a business, as you build stuff that customers want to buy. So, I think by utilising open source in general or CloudStack or any open-source tooling, it allows you to take a great set of features and functionality that will scale and then add your own secret sauce to it. Or as we often do, give back that secret sauce to the community so they can get a benefit from it as well.’</p><p><strong>Apache CloudStack: When and how it fits? </strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>‘I'd like to say that it can suit everyone, but I think that's probably not entirely true. I think that you have to have some level of expertise on your team in order to be able to support it long term. And that doesn't mean that you need to have a massive team. The fact that could be a team one, but it does take, as with any software platform in any project, it does take expertise in order to operate at long term. So, what I would say is, is that if you were thinking about deploying Apache CloudStack and you already have a few Linux chops under your belt, then that's probably more than enough for you to be able to explore and deploy. CloudStack is extraordinarily easy to deploy. We love to say that it just works. And that's a true statement. But if something starts to go south, if something starts to go wrong, you're going to have to start digging in a little better to the underpinnings of how the infrastructure works. Because you have to remember that CloudStack is effectively an orchestrator. It's managing other components. So those other components can go south, but CloudStack could be fine, right? So, it's important that you have a good understanding of how the ecosystem of various underpinnings of CloudStack functions so that you are more empowered to address problems if they do arise.’</p><p><strong>The Path of Constant Improvement</strong><strong>: </strong><strong>From IaaS to building PaaS products on top of Apache CloudStack</strong></p><p>‘I think the community is always looking for new ways to improve. No software platform is perfect, right? If it is, then we could just go home, open a bottle of wine, and everything would be great. To be realistic about it, there’s always new features. And the market is evolving at such a rapid pace these days that a lot of organisations are looking for new ways to be able to consume a service or consume a product. And I think that from CloudStack’s perspective, we've been very deliberate about where we plan, where we don't play. So, CloudStack has typically always been an infrastructure as a service orchestrator play. And there are other folks out there that are taking that as the underpinnings and building various platform as a service on top. So, I think there's always areas that we can improve and new features that we could add that are more underpinnings. But I think that one thing that we've always done really good at as a community is knowing where we play and where we don't play, because in the end it's fine to contribute a massive new feature, but if no one's going to support it long term, then it's very difficult to get others to come in and number one, help out with that and to be able to promote it.’</p><p><strong>Building a Stable Roadmap Inside an Open-source Community</strong></p><p>‘It often depends on open source of how the oversight is run. So, in some open-source projects, someone has decided that they want to open source and software and they put it up on GitHub and they are effectively God. They can do whatever they want. Whether other people support them or not is effectively irrelevant in that picture. But when you've got a large product or service that is inside a more structured entity such as Apache, we have a lot of guidance on how a community should interact. And I think honestly, that is very healthy because we really want others to contribute ideas. We need to have a robust discussion around things. And sometimes that robust discussion can be a bit difficult for certain people. But it is it is crucial that we get by from the community in order to chart the right path. So, I wouldn't say it's a typical product management style roadmap that we see in open source, but it is very important that as ideas are brought to the table, they are discussed and that others are willing to support the overall vision so that we do go in the right direction. I think the other component too and we see this quite a lot in CloudStack is, we have commercial entities out there that are providing support and development services. Good examples of that is ShapeBlue and CloudOps and others. And they have customers that might say, you know what? We want you to develop this new feature for CloudStack, and then they agree to open source it and give it back to the community. So that's also a great way to continue to feature development because those features are often very commercially driven. And considering we are obviously predominantly used by those that commercially driven, those features can be easy to adopt by others as well.’</p><p><strong>Release Management: Rapid Development of New Features and Capabilities</strong></p><p>‘We try and keep the release cadence pretty consistent overall. We have major releases and we have minor dot releases that are really focussed very much on critical bug fixes because in the end, the operator's utilising CloudStack expect stability. And so, we have to be quite deliberate about what we will allow and what we won't allow. So typically, when we're talking about a major release such as 4.16 or the future for 4.17, we are talking about new features that could be breaking changes. Potentially, we'll have high risk associated with them. If we're talking about 4.16.1, then we're talking about very, very minor changes that are totally focussed on stability and bug fixes. In terms of how we decide what features are going to new major release milestones, that's really got a lot to do with what has been reviewed and what the overall community is comfortable with. So, if an organisation or a developer brings in a new feature, they will open a pull request and they will request that to be merged and they will request review of that pull request via members of the community. And the members of the community will then make suggestions, or they might say, you know what, this is a cool feature, but we think it might break something else. And so, we would work with that contributor to figure out maybe how to re-implement that. But a very important part of CloudStack is stability. So, we always smoke test all of the new features that come in because we want to make sure that we are providing that long term stability that our users expect.’</p><p><strong>Becoming Part of Apache CloudStack: An advice for developers</strong></p><p>‘CloudStack is a huge project. I mean, the amount of code at times is a bit mind boggling. And I think the number one thing that I would recommend to someone who wants to get into development is become part of the mailing lists. You know, we have great development mailing lists, we have great user mailing lists and get a test environment set up, start to play with it, start to understand the features, how the features work in your environment, and then start to explore the code. And don't be scared of asking questions. You know, we have a great group of people who are really, really willing to help. And I, for one, want to make sure that anyone who comes to the community is going to get a benefit of being able to hopefully avoid the pain and suffering that some of us have gone through trying to figure out how certain things work. If you’re trying to implement something in a particular driver, I guarantee there’s someone that has already suffered that pain before. So just asking on the mailing list, we can find that right person for you and they can hopefully help shortcut that learning curve. And the events are fantastic. During the COVID era which has obviously been challenging for all of us, we have had some of our biggest online events. Ivet you have produced and made them super successful which is fantastic. And so, it’s just great seeing all these new people come out of the woodwork who are willing to learn and willing to become part of the community.’</p><p><strong>The Targets of the VP: Simon’s vision for the CloudStack development</strong></p><p>‘I’m very lucky that the PMC’s voted for me to be in this role and I just want to thank them for the support. Really, I just am going to be continuing on from the trailblazing people before me. We’ve had a great group of others that have been in the VP position over the last decade. And I think the number one thing that every single person in this role wants, is to help drive forward the vision in the community around Apache CloudStack. So, that’s really what I want to help do, I want to continue to talk to as many people as possible and hopefully encourage them to be part of the community so that we can continue to see the widescale success that we’re known for. And I think part of getting out there and promoting the overall project is the desire to have more users. Because in the end we need that strong user base to not just survive, but to thrive. And there’s always going to be a new use case that someone figures out. I think what we are starting to see more and more in the enterprise community right now is that public cloud is always going to be there. And I think that as some larger enterprises start to look at their costs associated with that, their starting to look a little bit more wider field of what the other options might be. So, we’re seeing more and more companies saying, well look I know we said we weren’t going to go and rent co-locations space again and put in servers and run our own cloud. But we should really run the numbers and figure out what they would look like’</p><p><strong>CloudStack in 3 words</strong></p><p>‘It just works’</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of April 2022, vulnerabilities in the Spring Framework for Java were publicly revealed. Many companies noticed active exploitation of the Spring4Shell vulnerability assigned as CVE-2022-22965. This vulnerability allows hackers to execute the Mirai botnet malware. The exploit allows threat actors to download the Mirai sample to the <code>/tmp</code> folder and execute them after changing its execute permission using <code>chmod</code>.</p><p>Currently, there are two vulnerabilities that allow malicious actors to achieve remote code execution (RCE) for Spring Framework - <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-22965" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2022-22965</a>, <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-22963" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2022-22963</a>.</p><p>The origin appears to be tracked to VMware products and spring-framework has published new releases <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-framework-rce-early-announcement#am-i-impacted" target="_blank" rel="noopener">v5.3.18 and v5.2.20</a> as mitigation.</p><p>CloudStack is not affected by Spring4Shell RCE and these CVEs because it isn't deployed as a WAR package and doesn't use Tomcat as the servlet container (it uses embedded Jetty and is deployed as an uber-jar). Further, it doesn't use spring-webmvc or spring-webflux dependencies.</p><p>As part of the Apache CloudStack project's routine maintenance and release efforts, a pull request towards the next 4.17 LTS release (4.17.0.0 milestone) that upgrades the spring-framework dependency to the latest v5.3.18 has been merged:</p><a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/6250/files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/6250/files</a>]]></content:encoded>

Most companies are evaluating how to migrate to newer, flexible, and automated platforms. Cloud-Native provides the answer, as well as the complications. Cloud-Native solutions are building themselves alone across the business, but who's securing them? Jesus will discuss the evolution of infrastructure solutions to Cloud Native, how can they be secured on CloudStack, what opensource security options are available today for CloudStack and where the future is leading towards Cloud Native security for CloudStack.</p><p><strong>15:00 - 15:30 - Boosting I/O Performance with KVM io_uring, </strong>Wido den Hollander, CLDIN B.V.<u></u></p><p>Storage performance is becoming much more important. KVM io_uring attempts to bring the I/O performance of a virtual machine to almost the same level as bare metal. Apache CloudStack has support for io_uring since version 4.16. Wido will show the difference in performance io_uring brings to the table.</p><p><strong>15:40 - 16:10 - Backup and Restore VMs based on KVM, </strong>Quentin Roccia &amp; Joffrey Luangsaysana, Dimsi</p><p>Dimsi has developed a backup solution for Virtual Machines based on KVM hypervisors. Every layer of the product uses Open Source libraries or components (Python, VueJS, Celery, Borg Backup, Redis, Socketio, Flask). There is no agent needed on the VMs. Dimsi has implemented a feature to group the hosts based on their use (CloudStack Hosts or Management Hosts) and apply specific policies to the groups. In the CloudStack context, this product can help you backup and restore all your VMs easily if the hypervisors are KVM-based. Moreover, restoring the VMs is effortless because KVM and CloudStack use the same id for the VM disks, so no need to hack the database to match them.</p><p><strong>16:20 - 17:05 - A Kubernetes CAPI Provider for Apache CloudStack, </strong>Peter (Motyka) Motykowski, Sr. Software Development Manager - Customer Engineering at Amazon Web Services (AWS)</p><p>Discover the new Kubernetes CAPI (Cluster-API) provider for Apache CloudStack "CAPC", enabling you to manage a range of Kubernetes clusters across Apache CloudStack and other supported infrastructure providers!CAPI is a Kubernetes sub-project focused on providing declarative APIs and tooling to simplify provisioning, upgrading, and operating multiple Kubernetes clusters. Started by the Kubernetes SIG (Special Interest Group) Cluster Lifecycle, the CAPI project uses Kubernetes-style APIs and patterns to automate cluster lifecycle management for platform operators. CAPI relies on infrastructure providers to provision the underlying infrastructure components.<br>In this talk, you will find out more about the newly developed provider, its capabilities, and how you can benefit from it!</p><p><strong>17:15 - 17:45 - Expose Router VM Statistics to Customers, </strong>Sina Kashipazha, Leaseweb</p><p>In recent years, some of Leaseweb’s customers complained about the router VM resource usage and its availability. This made the company think that it would be nice to expose router VM statistics to the customers using the Prometheus format. In that way, they can set up their monitoring system and have more visibility over their network. Although it is still under development, Leaseweb thought it would be nice to discuss the project with the community members and gather feedback.</p><p><strong>17:45 - 19:00 - Networking and Beers</strong></p><hr><p><a href="https://events.hubilo.com/cloudstack-european-user-group/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>REGISTER NOW</strong></a></p><hr><p><strong>LEARN MORE ABOUT THE SPEAKERS:</strong></p><p><strong>Giles Sirett</strong></p><p>Giles is a committer, PMC member of the Apache CloudStack project and Chairman of the European CloudStack User Group.

We are a welcoming society for new contributors and people keen on technology. This blog series will present you with recent CloudStack Committers and PMC members. Learn more about our tech society!</p><p>Meet Nicolas Vazquez! He is a Senior Software Engineer at ShapeBlue and is a PMC member of the Apache CloudStack project. He spends his time designing and implementing features in&nbsp; CloudStack and can be seen acting as a release manager also.</p><p><strong>Introduce yourself with a few words?</strong></p><p>My name is Nicolas Vazquez, and I am a software engineer. I am 31 years old, based in Uruguay and work as a Senior Software Engineer at Shapeblue. I'm happily married and also a father of a young girl. I am a fan of sports, enjoy playing tennis and football. I also enjoy reading and listening to economic and political materials.</p><p><strong>Tell us your story in one Tweet?</strong></p><p>I have a degree in Computer Science and have worked on software development for the last 9 years. For the first years, I have worked mostly as a Java developer and since I met CloudStack I have been learning more about networking, storage, virtualisation. I became a CloudStack Committer in 2016 and a PMC member last year.</p><p><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>I have met CloudStack in 2015 while I was working for my previous job. I personally didn't know about CloudStack but got assigned to a development project for it and that is where I started investigating and learning about it. I have been actively contributing and learning a lot since then.</p><p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>My first mentor was Sergey Levitskiy. After I have joined Shapeblue, my mentor has been Rohit Yadav. I admire and appreciate both of them. I also enjoy acting as a mentor, recently have been assisting other community members - Suresh on the Release Management of the 4.16.1.0 release - which was released earlier this month.</p><p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong></p><p>My last commitment to CloudStack was acting as the Release Manager for the version 4.16.0 and also for the upcoming 4.17.0 version. Version 4.16.0 was released in November 2021 and introduces many interesting new features and improvements.</p><p>I am currently contributing by being the Release Manager for the upcoming 4.17 release of CloudStack. It is expected to bring a bunch of enhancements and new capabilities, such as improvements in the IPv6 support, shared networks, UX improvements for VM and volume migration and a lot more.</p><p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong></p><p>I think the power of open-source technologies is that these solutions are not bound to any company and are the result of many individuals from different companies interacting and cooperating to build the best possible product. This is beneficial for the users as the product can be extended by anyone and contributed back to the whole community. Last but not least, the support of the community is also very important, and in my opinion, CloudStack is an excellent example of a successful open-source project.</p><p><strong>Learn more about Nicolas:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nvazquez" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/nvazquez</a></p><p><strong>Follow him on Twitter: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/nvazquezuy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/nvazquezuy</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apache CloudStack prior to 4.16.1.0 used insecure random number generation for project invitation tokens. If a project invite is created based only on an email address, a random token is generated. An attacker with knowledge of the project ID and the fact that the invite is sent, could generate time deterministic tokens and brute force attempt to use them prior to the legitimate receiver accepting the invite.</p><p>This feature is not enabled by default, the attacker is required to know or guess the project ID for the invite in addition to the invitation token, and the attacker would need to be an existing authorized user of CloudStack. Due to this the impact is considered low risk. As of 9th March 2022, this is now tracked under CVE-2021-44228: <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26779</a></p><p>To mitigate the risk, a CloudStack admin can do any of the following:</p><p>1. Disable the feature by setting `project.invitation.required` to false.</p><p>2. Disable the project SMTP global settings.</p><p>3. Upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.16.1.0 or higher.</p>]]></content:encoded>

We are a welcoming society for new contributors and people keen on technology. This blog series will present you with recent CloudStack Committers and PMC members. Learn more about our tech society!</p><p>Meet Slavka Peleva from StorPool Storage. Slavka is a software developer and has been announced as a CloudStack Committer at the end of 2021. She is part of the CloudStack community for the last 3 years and is excited to work on new features and capabilities to improve the open-source cloud management solution.</p><p><strong>Introduce yourself with a few words?</strong><br>Hi, I am Slavka Peleva and I work at StorPool Storage as a software developer. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Automation, information and control systems. I am a mother of a teenage boy. I love to read fantasy books, snowboarding in winters and rollerblading in summers.</p><p><strong>Tell us your story in one Tweet.</strong><br>I have always loved puzzles and brain teasers. For me, programming is an art. I have a passion for debugging and digging into the code.</p><p><br><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong><br>In the middle of 2019 I have started to work at StorPool Storage. Then I did my first steps into CloudStack and it was my first open-source project. Since then I learned a lot and I met interesting people.</p><p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong><br>My colleagues at StorPool. I аm very happy that I have the chance to work with such exceptional professionals. Thanks to them the beginning was not so hard. I should also thank Rohit Yadav and ShapeBlue who shared with me the hackerbook. When I felt a bit comfortable in the community I have started to bother most of the guys :) I am glad that the people in CloudStack's community are really supportive and nice and they have helped me in my journey.</p><p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong><br>Most of my contributing PRs are related to fixes with storage issues. One of the features that I have developed in CloudStack still did not get in but I hope that happens in the next release. It is for storage-based VM snapshots on KVM. Libvirt does not give the option to take virtual machine snapshots on images with RAW format. With this feature, the storage will have the functionality to take group consistent snapshots on all volumes of a virtual machine.</p><p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong><br>The biggest advantage is the quality. A lot of developers are actively going through the code and making changes and only the best changes get into the final version. The contributions that every one of us does is what makes CloudStack such a powerful technology that so many system administrators and solutions architects use to build up their clouds.</p><p><strong>Learn more about Slavka:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/slavkap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/slavkap</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="/blog/cloud-iaas-predictions-for-2022"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/b735d3a3-b098-4c3c-87b5-5ed88a12bf65" alt="Cloud/IaaS Predictions" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p><strong>It's the beginning of the new year, and here the Apache CloudStack community shares its predictions about the state of open-source technology and the future of Cloud/IaaS.</strong> While some well-established trends (such as the migration to hybrid cloud environments and containerization) will continue in 2022, the potential for disruption caused by the ongoing pandemic will drive IT to accelerated change and improvement.</p><p>The Cloud/IaaS market is constantly evolving, and the ability to run workloads on Kubernetes, both on-premise and on public cloud infrastructure is vital to ensure business agility. Container-based cloud-native applications promise to deliver computing power independent of the cloud provider or hardware platform and is the biggest trend registered widely by users and the market, as there are changes in cultural and technological paradigms.</p><p>In terms of cloud management systems used to orchestrate Cloud/IaaS environments, the main goal for companies in 2022 is decreasing operational effort and thus costs. Providers will be looking for platforms that can increase their competitiveness and deliver predictable results while eliminating licensing and vendor lock-in.</p><p>Apache CloudStack follows the technology wave and responds to the user demand for innovation and improvement. As part of this strategy, it is integrating Kubernetes and extending IPv6 support in the latest versions. Huge progress has been made in the installation and upgrade processes, making Apache CloudStack even easier to maintain and operate.</p><p><br><strong>In this article, we will echo the voice of our community and wait for 2022 to pass to see which of the following predictions will become mainstream.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Adoption of Open-source Technologies Will Continue to Grow</h2><p>Building an open-source environment with Apache CloudStack is a future-proof strategy for many Cloud / IaaS providers. A lot of enterprises now have the challenge of consolidating different environments under the hood of a single orchestration platform while ensuring minimal downtime of production environments. The CloudStack community believes that open-source, lightweight technologies like Apache CloudStack will be adopted more and more by companies who want to achieve simplicity, improve performance and scale instantly when needed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- <strong>Wido den Hollander, CEO/CTO at <a href="https://www.tws.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLouDINfra</a>:</strong></p><p><em>“My challenges for 2022 are migrating and adopting legacy infrastructure into our Cloud(Stack) environment. While keeping customer services up and running we want to achieve these goals. Having everything central in a single cloud management platform gives me better insight on our performance, capacity and expansion needs.”</em></p><p>- <strong>Boyan Ivanov, CEO, <a href="https://storpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StorPool:</a></strong></p><p><em>“The commoditization of IT started with the adoption of commodity hardware and open-source technologies like Linux &amp; KVM in hyperscalers. It is increasingly pervasive and leading to the commoditizing of the storage industry. We are seeing the emergence of Software-Defined Storage and Software-Defined Networking (among many other things), which have now become the default technologies to use in greenfield projects or refresh scenarios.”</em></p><p><em>- </em><strong>Sven Vogel, Senior Manager R&amp;D - Cloud and Infrastructure, <a href="https://www.ewerk.com/startseite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EWERK:</a></strong></p><p><em>“</em><em>Today, many infrastructure deployments are using open-source technology as a key component.&nbsp; Through 2025, more than 70% of enterprises will increase their IT spending on open-source software, compared with their current IT spending, and by 2025, 75% of application development teams will implement software composition analysis tools in their workflow, up from 40% today, in order to minimize the security and licensing risks associated with open-source software. Source: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/4004007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner, <strong>Hype Cycle for Open-Source Software, 2021</strong></a>. </em></p><p><em>I share this assumption but I would also like to point out that more and more open-source projects hardly get any support. Many commercial companies are using OSS but it’s also important to understand that the industry needs to support the people who make the projects &nbsp;live.” </em></p><p>- <strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, <a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p><p><em>“</em><em>Open-source is here to stay - there is no better software model for innovation and long-term sustainability. However, far too many companies do not have a solid strategy on open-source. They use open-source software but do not understand the open-source model and how to engage in that model. The recent Log4J vulnerability demonstrated this perfectly. I expect to see many organisations finally thinking about how to properly run open-source in their environments and recognising that they can’t just install the software and forget”</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Kubernetes</h2><p>The approach to delivering microservices and containerized applications in recent years changed completely the way we design, develop, and run web applications. New principles enable developers to create cloud-native applications using Kubernetes which side-by-side with open-source, is a hot topic for most Apache CloudStack community members who share their visions.</p><p>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-beims-brascher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Gabriel Beims Bräscher, VP Apache CloudStack</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p><em>“We already see significant growth in deployed containerized workloads and there is no reason to believe in 2022 it won't be a big deal. CloudStack also has been moving towards providing Kubernetes containers. This could trigger providers to start planning their move towards "containers as a service" as well.”</em></p><p>- <strong>Rohit Yadav, Principal Engineer, <a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p><p><em>“Kubernetes managed container-based workloads are becoming the new norm, and multi-arch container builds (same apps built as containers that can run on both x86, aarch64 etc. architectures) becoming easily available for most apps/software/packages will make this change and migration easier. For the end-users/developers at large, it doesn't / won't matter what tech/arch their workloads are running on.” </em></p><p>- <strong>Kshitish Purohit, Chief Product Officer, <a href="https://www.apiculus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndiQus Technologies</a>:</strong></p><p><em>“Kubernetes and cloud-native infrastructure will slowly start edging out virtualisation and traditional orchestration. And as this demand for cloud-native infrastructure grows, the older 'enterprise' mindset will need to make way for decentralisation and autonomy.”</em></p><p>- <strong>Ezequiel McGovern - <a href="https://www.arsat.com.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARSAT</a>:</strong></p><p><em>“The new software solutions are implemented on container technology. With scaling, shared storage and high availability, we believe that this will lead to more common use of local hypervisor storage, allowing multizone solutions to be deployed without the need for the Cloud manager to perform additional tasks.”</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>COVID Impact on Cloud / IaaS providers</h2><p>Since the beginning of the COVID pandemic, we have seen a real impact in terms of life and workstyle. Inevitably two industries have developed the most during the pandemic - healthcare and IT. With the growing demand for XaaS,</p><p>- <strong>Rohit Yadav, Principal Engineer, <a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p><p><em>“Due to covid, WFH and remote working have become the new norm, and are here for the long term. This means demand for everything to support this life (work) style will continue to grow, with an increased need for Data Centre and cloud resources. Providers in telecom, data centre, and cloud space will continue to cater to this growing demand.” </em></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><h2><em>&nbsp;A</em>RM Platform</h2><p>Recently, Apple introduced the ARM M1 processor as a replacement for Intel in its products, and KVM and VMware already support virtualization based on ARM processors. What’s next? Take a look at our predictions:</p><p>- <strong>Rohit Yadav, Principal Engineer, <a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p><p><em>“On the consumer front, most mobile and IoT devices are already ARM-based. Apple are leading the charge with their Mx series chips-based laptops and computers, and I think other manufacturers will follow (I think AMD should certainly consider grabbing this early market). We should see more ARM-based laptops in the next 5-10 yrs. More of these consumer devices means more developers will start using ARM-based computers to create apps, services, etc. that run on ARM and generate a requirement for more ARM-based servers/cloud providers. The strategy that will lead change is to build the ecosystem which is appearing to be working; a good business/developer benefit is that you'll write apps that will then run on mobile, IoT, laptop/consumer computers, and also in the cloud.”</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Edge Computing, Blockchain and Green Cloud</h2><p>The world's data is expected to grow 61% to 175 zettabytes by 2025. According to Gartner, around 10% of enterprise-generated data is created and processed outside a traditional centralized data center or cloud. By 2025, Gartner predicts that this figure will reach 75%. The increase of IoT devices at the edge of the network is producing a massive amount of data - storing and using all that data in cloud data centers pushes network bandwidth requirements to the limit.</p><p>- <strong>Kshitish Purohit, Chief Product Officer, <a href="https://www.apiculus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IndiQus Technologies</a>:</strong></p><p><em>“Web3 is already here and 2022 is going to see a lot of movement happening in this space. The 'decentralised tech' landscape will find firmer ground as more understanding is built on the use of blockchains, edge and the likes. 2021 already saw this potential with big companies (and even governments) adopting these new technologies - crypto, AI, AR, metaverse etc. - and these are going to continue on an upward trend.”</em></p><p>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-beims-brascher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Gabriel Beims Bräscher, VP Apache CloudStack</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p><em>“We are still far from ideal "green" data centres, but this has become relevant in the past years. An example of the relevancy of this subject can be seen at the European Commission's <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/green-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Green cloud and green data centres</strong></a> policy. Additionally, studies show that moving companies' internal workloads to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/09/23/how-cloud-migration-and-ai-can-help-reduce-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud providers can reduce the CO2 footprint</a>. In 2022 we might see more ideas and proposals on how to improve efficiency, reducing energy costs and CO2 footprint. It is still hard to apply academic studies to the industry, but 2022 might be a year where we start changing it.”</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>IPv6 Stack</h2><p>The continued expansion of the internet relies on a greater number of IP addresses, and with the current limitation of the IPv4 stack, it is impossible to continue this expansion. The advent of cloud-native applications based on containerized microservices requires a relatively large number of public addresses, so the use of 128-bit IPv6 stacks that, theoretically allowing IP addresses, allows for continued expansion.</p><p>- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-beims-brascher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Gabriel Beims Bräscher, VP Apache CloudStack</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p><em>“It is not news, IPv4 is reaching its limit. And each year we see companies and services being moved towards IPv6. This includes recent movements in Kubernetes 1.23 where Dual-stack IPv4 / IPv6 Networking has reached general availability (GA), in the last quarter of 2021.”</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Market Dynamics</h2><p>- <strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, <a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p><p><em>“</em><em>The meteoritic growth in the IaaS market is well documented and predicted by most analysts to continue strongly through 2022. There are lots of different numbers flying around but most of the analysts seem to settle on a c.30% YoY growth for IaaS - taking it to near 100 billion markets in 2022.&nbsp; Interestingly, the market share for the hyperscalers remains constant at about 80% - as much as most service providers would love to have some of that 80%, that still leaves a 20 billion growth market for everybody else.”</em></p><p>- <strong>Ezequiel McGovern - <a href="https://www.arsat.com.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARSAT</a>:</strong></p><p><em>“The concept of buying VMs will gradually change to buying Docker clusters (K8S) or similar solutions, so cloud managers have to prepare to provide services that are further away from the hypervisor.”</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Private Cloud No More</h2><p>The private or on-premise cloud allows a company to run workloads in their private data center. It is increasingly common to see companies migrating their workloads to cloud providers, thus reducing CAPEX-related costs. See the prediction on this topic below.</p><p>- <strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, <a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p><p><em>“For a decade, the term private cloud has been used to describe a set of orchestrated/automated infrastructure components to give users a “cloud-like” experience of their own internal infra. Increasingly, environments such as this are being used as the foundation for automation - they become part of the plumbing instead of the end goal itself. I’d therefore predict the term private-cloud starting to disappear from our lexicon.”</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Hybrid Cloud</h2><p>The use of multiple clouds, public and on-premise, allows operators to run applications based on containers in geographically dispersed locations of different providers, thus increasing the high availability of the applications and reducing the latency since, depending on the architecture, it allows operators to distribute the workloads to the cloud closest to the users using IP geolocation as well as edge clouds.</p><p>- <strong>Boyan Ivanov, CEO, <a href="https://storpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StorPool:</a></strong></p><p><strong>Hybrid capabilities become crucial going forward </strong>- <em>“Due to mixed environments and new workloads, storage complexity is increasing, not decreasing. So agility, portability, and well-documented APIs are now prime considerations when designing cloud-native applications. These applications should run on-premises and off-premises in the same manner but on different hardware and software stacks. So agility, flexibility, versatility, integrations and APIs become key KPIs of a storage solution, along with performance (think latency, IOPS, GB/S) and TCO (think Total Cost of Ownership, $/GB)</em>.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Traditional SAN and Software-Defined-Storage</h2><p>On the storage market, the innovations and SDS will continue steadily to replace legacy technologies. It's a natural case of evolution. By using API-compatible devices, you can control granular details like IOPs, snapshots and scaling without any headaches. The natural evolution of storage is software-defined storage (SDS), decoupling and abstracting storage resources from the underlying hardware platform for greater flexibility, efficiency and rapid scalability, making storage resources programmable and scalable.</p><p>- <strong>Boyan Ivanov, CEO, <a href="https://storpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StorPool:</a></strong></p><p><em>“The diversity from emerging applications puts strain on traditional, legacy SAN products and platforms. The storage solutions </em><em>have been largely unchanged for the last three decades, except for the introduction of faster storage media (SSDs / NVMes) and extra data management software pieces (AI, anyone?) on top of the same underlying rigid architecture. Yet the large-scale, complex, and versatile IT platforms that power businesses today need a new generation of powerful and versatile storage platforms. These storage platforms can cover multiple use-cases, performance tiers, have API-first management, and linearly scale to sizes which were impossible with the traditional SAN architecture. Besides: who wants to buy and manage five different types of SAN / AFA family groups if they can have one or two best-in-class, latest generation SDS storage solutions?”&nbsp; </em></p><p>- <strong>Ezequiel McGovern - <a href="https://www.arsat.com.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARSAT</a>:</strong></p><p><em>“Regarding the shared storage needs for classic solutions, the use of Ceph will be established, since it has shown in production that everything it promises is fulfilled in real life.”</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The predictions seem clear and achievable. As a constantly developing software, Apache CloudStack follows the trends and evolves with the market needs. Apache CloudStack follows the open-source philosophy and has a strong and united community. It has recently been integrated with Kubernetes and extended IPv6 support for VPC and isolated networks. The Apache CloudStack use cases cover edge computing and hybrid cloud workloads. Besides that, the market for IaaS/Cloud will generate greater demand for hyperscalers, but also for service providers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Apache Log4j 2.x is reported to be affected as it performs a lookup (string substitution) using the JNDI protocol, whenever the "${jndi:...}" string is found within a message parameter.</p><p>The Apache <a href="https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-990494126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Log4j developers</a> and the <a href="http://slf4j.org/log4shell.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SLF4J project advisory</a> confirm that Apache Log4j 1.x does not offer a look-up mechanism and does not suffer remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability from CVE-2021-44228.</p><p>All Apache CloudStack releases since v4.6 use Apache Log4j version 1.2.17 and therefore are not affected by this RCE vulnerability. Most users who haven't changed the default log4j xml config don't need to do anything, advanced users can check and fix their log4j xml configuration if they're using any custom JMS appenders.</p><p>The Apache CloudStack project will consider migrating to a different version of Apache Log4j in future releases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="/blog/what-s-new-in-apache"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/9c07a866-c997-4b88-b17c-29203c8219c8" width="100%" alt="ACS-416.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Apache CloudStack 4.16 is the latest release of the cloud management platform from the Apache Software Foundation and is a result of months of work from the development community. 4.16 is an LTS (Long Term Support) release so will be maintained for a period of 18 months after release.</p><p>As always, the release contains a myriad of small improvements and bug fixes but here we focus on the major new functionality of the release.</p><h2>New CloudStack Integrations</h2><p>Two new major storage integrations are shipped with 4.16.</p><div><b>CloudStack and Dell PowerFlex Integration</b><a href="/img/imported/74265a54-7441-47a3-910e-b042f919d5c1"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/74265a54-7441-47a3-910e-b042f919d5c1?t=true" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>A plugin for Dell PowerFlex (previously ScaleIO ) allows CloudStack to directly manage primary storage pools and enable enhanced VM &amp; Volume operations on that pool including volume migrations. This integration is available for PowerFlex versions 4.3 onwards and only for the KVM hypervisor at this stage.</p></div><br><div><b>LINBIT and CloudStack Integration</b><a href="/img/imported/8c768dc5-210a-41fc-911b-0f2f2f7c7453"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/8c768dc5-210a-41fc-911b-0f2f2f7c7453?t=true" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Support has also been added for Linstor storage. The plugin, again, allows CloudStack to manage Linstor volumes for primary storage and also supports snapshots.</p><p>LINBIT SDS is deeply integrated with Apache CloudStack. It has a native driver in the OS which provides block devices to the KVM. The CloudStack integration helps administrators to manage storage functions like snapshots, migration with the API.</p></div><div><b>Enhancements to CloudStack Kubernetes Service</b><a href="/img/imported/a407189f-02c6-4c71-ae99-bf0f99783fdf"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/a407189f-02c6-4c71-ae99-bf0f99783fdf?t=true" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>CloudStack Kubernetes Service (CKS)  first shipped in CloudStack 4.14 and provides full Kubernetes integration to CloudStack – allowing users to run containerized services using Kubernetes clusters without the pain of having to deploy Kubernetes clusters themselves</p><p>CloudStack 4.16 brings a number of improvements to CKS. Kubernetes autoscaling is now supported through the creation of a Kubernetes provider for CloudStack. This means that Kubernetes will be able to scale up a cluster if pods cannot be scheduled and then scale it back down.</p><p>The base template for Kubernetes clusters in CloudStack has now been unified with the existing System VM Template, removing the dependency on CoreOS and simplifying ongoing maintenance.</p></div><h2>UI Improvements</h2>The previous release saw a new, improved user interface experience for Apache CloudStack  – for both users and administrators. 4.16 sees many new features in that interface, all designed to make interactions with CloudStack easier.<p>It is now possible to select multiple objects (i.e. Instances, volumes, etc) and perform actions against that bulk selection. For example, if you wish to restart 10 instances or lock 5 accounts, these types of actions can easily be done with a single click.</p><a href="/img/imported/7dd821bd-4237-4ac8-88d9-657f97e01429"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/7dd821bd-4237-4ac8-88d9-657f97e01429" alt="416-zone_card_view.png" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>The UI has become much more visual with the addition of configurable icons for most types of resources. For example, zones can now be represented by geographical flags or instances by their OS type. Users can even upload a profile picture of themselves.</p><p>These icons can be configured at the administrator level and also overridden by individual users.</p><p>Users can also now make comments or notes against most resource types.  This can be used for making simple configuration notes or even as a full changelog against an object. This is available for most resource types including Instances, domains, hosts, SSH keypairs, volumes, snapshots, etc</p><p>A full audit log of comments is maintained, including the date stamp and the user who made the comment. Administrators are able to create and remove comments from any object and can see all the comments on every object. Permissions are applied to domain administrators and users, allowing them to comment, remove and see comments only on the entities they have access to.</p><p>There is also a new “Comments” section under the main menu, allowing users to see all of their comments across all objects and types.</p><a href="/img/imported/e40e8bff-146e-445c-ace9-f48130b1f977"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/e40e8bff-146e-445c-ace9-f48130b1f977" alt="416-comments.png" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>The final UI improvement is a big time saver. Users can now submit any form by pressing CTRL Enter.</p><h2>Upgrade Improvements</h2><p>The last few versions of CloudStack have all seen major improvements to the upgrade process, with the overall goal of “zero downtime upgrades” getting ever closer.</p><p>4.16 sees this work continue: the requirement to manually register the system VM Template before an upgrade has now been removed. Template registration is now automated as part of the package upgrade process.</p><p>The database upgrade process has also been refined and can be run without needing the root user credentials.</p><h2>Improved Tools &amp; Management</h2><p>The ability to import and export existing Virtual machines as CloudStack instances is an area that has seen a lot of focus in recent versions. 4.16 sees new functionality in the UI that allows admins to take existing VMWare instances for a VMWare cluster and quickly put them under CloudStack management (or to “unmanage” them in reverse). This functionality was previously available only as an API command.</p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/580a39af-db79-4391-bb0f-83404d7018b3" alt="416-comments.png" class="img_ev3q"><p>Whether an instance is allowed to dynamically scale can now be controlled in a very granular fashion, down to the level of a template or an individual instance. Previously, this was only configurable on a global basis. The hot adding of CPU and RAM.</p><p>CloudStack’s host HA feature has been extended to allow a host to be placed in a “degraded” state. In this state, HA kicks in to migrate workloads away, but the host is left running.</p><p>Enhancements have been made to pod management to allow administrators to be able to update the size of the IP range of the management pod, upwards or downwards.</p><p>Finally, CloudStack 4.16 sees an overhaul of the products documentation to reflect the new user interface.</p><h2>Documentation and Downloads</h2><p>The full list of new features can be found in the project release notes at <a href="https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.16.0.0/releasenotes/changes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.16.0.0/releasenotes/changes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.16.0.0/releasenotes/changes.html</a></p><p>The CloudStack documentation includes upgrade instructions from previous versions of Apache CloudStack, and can be found at: <a href="https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.16.0.0/upgrading/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.16.0.0/upgrading/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.16.0.0/upgrading/index.html</a></p><p>The official installation, administration and API documentation for each of the releases are available on our documentation page: <a href="https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/</a></p><p>Download the new release here: <a href="https://cloudstack.apache.org/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><a href="https://cloudstack.apache.org/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cloudstack.apache.org/downloads.html</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gabriel Beims Bräscher is the new VP of Apache CloudStack since March 2021. He started his journey with CloudStack when he was still a student in the university, became fast a contributor, PMC member and now he is VP of the project.</p><p>Gabriel is a quite interesting person – born and living in Brazil, but working for a Dutch company, he seems to be an international person. On the technology side, he is an experienced Java developer and has a deep knowledge in a range of other technology. On the personal side, Gabriel is excited to help CloudStack grow as a community and spread the knowledge for it as much a possible.</p><p>Meet Gabriel – the new VP of Apache CloudStack. A person, who is friendly, open-minded and ready to help everyone in the community!</p><a href="/img/imported/6d6dbf9f-d964-496f-82af-a4c764e5f865"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/6d6dbf9f-d964-496f-82af-a4c764e5f865?t=true" alt="Gabriel-VPACS.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></a><b>1. What exactly is the role of VP of Apache CloudStack?</b><p>To give some context let’s start with a bit of Apache.</p><p>The Apache Software Foundation controls over 300+ Projects. Therefore, it is quite hard for a single Apache Board to stay close and manage all the projects.</p><p>With that in mind, each project holds a group of contributors capable of managing supervising the project following the Apache guidelines; this group is called Project Management Committee (PMC). A project VP is a PMC Chair appointed by the Apache Board.</p><p>The VP serves as a bridge between the ASF Board and the Project, providing reports to the Apache Board on a quarterly basis. VP also holds an important role in terms of marketing the project and orchestrating discussions.</p><br><b>2. If you look at CloudStack, it has played a critical role for many solutions providers and companies who search for ease of use and deployment. Which companies can benefit the most from CloudStack?</b><p>Any company that deploys and consumes large loads of computer resources can benefit from CloudStack. Some examples are:</p><p>· Cloud Providers: they are a perfect match as their core business is Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)</p><p>· Telecommunications Companies: are transiting to large cloud infrastructures; especially with the wide change on the communication industry (migrating from traditional Telephone &amp; TV to wireless mobile and Internet technologies)</p><p>· Universities and Research Rroups: need large scale systems for running experiments and also maintaining multiple services for students, professors, and researchers</p><p>· Enterprises / Governmental Organizations: they process and store loads of data, and need elastic computer resources to comply with their demands</p><p>In summary, these companies have something in common:</p><ol><li><p>The costs with public clouds are higher than deploying and managing their own Private Cloud.</p></li><li><p>Also, some companies must control their data and will not process them on third-parties.</p></li></ol><p>In all those cases CloudStack has proven to be a competitive option.</p><br><b>3. Choosing a cloud management system is a hard thing, especially if you have a long history with specific technologies. Why should companies migrate to CloudStack?</b><p>That is true. Choosing such a system is hard and it requires evaluating many aspects, such as the goals, expectations, and technical background that the company already has.</p><p>CloudStack can handle a wide set of hypervisors, and instead of creating new components and projects, it focuses on connecting and managing solid technologies such as iSCSI, NFS, and Ceph. Additionally, it allows configuring guest networks with IPv6 protocol for VMs, which is not commonly supported by other cloud orchestration systems.</p><p>In short: a good thing from CloudStack for companies planning to migrate to Private Cloud is that it adopted technologies that are out in the industry for decades and most of the Admins and Engineers are already used to them. This can cut deployment and operation costs.</p><br><b>4. On the development side, how easy it is to implement and manage CloudStack?</b><p>CloudStack, as any other cloud orchestration platform, is a complex solution; it requires IT professionals with multidisciplinary backgrounds, such as development skills (e.g. Java, Python, MySQL, Bash, Git, Node.js), as well as experience with virtualization, networking and storage systems. So it might take some time for a new developer to learn its way. However, Apache projects work hard to help newcomers; and CloudStack is no different. There are documentations that guide users, system admins, and developers. Deploying CloudStack can be easy when compared to other options and operating it can be simple to users that are well adapted with all the technologies in CloudStack.</p><br><b>5. What would you share about the community?</b><p>The fact that the project is managed by Apache Software Foundation provides all the Apache background on building an open-source community. It is one of our core goals to encourage experienced developers and users to help newcomers.</p><p>On top of that, assembling a community where everyone has a saying is one of the foundations of Apache projects. Therefore, we are always open to new ideas and feature requests.</p><br><b>6. How do you think we can all grow the CloudStack community?</b><p>It is very important to grow our community and I strongly believe that we should connect to students, researchers and professors in a way that we can bring young and passionate talents to develop our project.</p><p>Additionally, participating in conferences and writing for technical magazines can advertise Cloud computing Infrastructure-as-a-Service model as well as the CloudStack project.</p><br><b>7. What is the direction in which CloudStack is going as a technology?</b><p>We are working hard to keep it a reliable and stable solution; but it is also key to invest on user-friendly experience. A good project is one that can be easily deployed and used. We have been continuously enhancing the documentation; additionally, CloudStack has recently migrated to a new User Interface.</p><br><b>8. Many community members notice that CloudStack is becoming more and more appealing for enterprises. What would you advise this type of organisations?</b><p>Small-medium enterprises need to determine which deployment model best suits their Cloud strategy. There are pros and cons on any of the cloud options (private, public, or hybrid clouds).</p><p>Considering the complexity and challenges of deploying a cloud infrastructure, CloudStack is reliable, easy to deploy, and can scale well. Additionally, CloudStack supports integration with public clouds; therefore it is a great option for hybrid clouds.</p><p>We have many known cases of companies that use it for a long time and have scaled their CloudStack Data Centers to huge amounts of Hosts and VMs. But there are also examples of small organizations that are benefiting from private clouds either as a key component of their core business or a tool for internal IT development and growth.</p><br><b>9. As a person, you are recognized for your contribution to CloudStack. How did you start with it?</b><p>It all started in 2013, when I was an undergrad student working at a research lab that wanted to deploy a Cloud orchestration platform. We chose CloudStack over all the options and I began my journey on the CloudStack world.</p><p>On the 1st November 2013 I sent my first mail to the CloudStack mailing list with some questions regarding the process of upgrading from CloudStack 4.1.1 to 4.2.0.</p><p>In December of 2015 I opened my first Pull Request, which led me to work closer to the community by interacting at the mailing lists, and proposing and reviewing implementations.</p><p>I became a committer in 2017 and worked as a Release Manager for CloudStack 4.12.0.0 in early 2018. By the end of 2018 I was invited to be part of the Apache CloudStack PMC.</p><br><b>10. Any advice to all developers, writing new features for CloudStack?</b><p>Open source is all about multiple developers creating and fixing code together; we must focus on maintainability, stability, and documentation.</p><p>When writing new features we should think about how other developers will debug and extend the code. In summary: write code as simple as possible.</p><p>I would recommend the following principles:</p><ol><li><p>Use clear and self-explaining variable names</p></li><li><p>Take advantage of coding libraries to use existing tools</p></li><li><p>Make it easy for other developers to work into the workflow</p></li><li><p>Keep it well documented</p></li><li><p>Make code reusable and avoid duplicated lines</p><br></li></ol><b>11. If you need to summarize CloudStack in 3 words, what would they be?</b><p>Open-source reliable clouds, or simply: it goes on!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[The original CloudMonkey was contributed to the Apache CloudStack project on 31]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The original CloudMonkey was contributed to the Apache CloudStack project on 31
Oct 2012 under the Apache License 2.0. It is written in Python and shipped using
the Python CheeseShop, and since its inception has gone through several
refactors and rewrites. While this has worked well over the years, the
installation and usage have been limited to just a few modern platforms due to
the dependency on Python 2.7, meaning it is hard to install on older
distributions such as CentOS6.</p><p>Over the past two years, several attempts have been made to make the code compatible across Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.x. However, it proved to be a maintenance and release challenge – making it code compatible across all the platforms, all the Python versions and the varied dependency versions; whilst also keeping it easy to install and use. During late 2017, an experimental CloudMonkey rewrite called cmk was written in Go, a modern, statically typed and compiled programming language which could produce cross-platforms standalone binaries. Finally, in early 2018, after reaching a promising state the results of the experiment were shared with the community, to build support and gather feedback for moving the CloudMonkey codebase to Go and deprecate the Python version.</p><br>During 2018, two Go-based ports were written using two different readline and prompt libraries. The alpha / beta builds were shared with the community who tested them, reported bugs and provided valuable feedback (especially around tab-completion) which drove the final implementation. With the new rewrite CloudMonkey (for the first time) ships as a single executable file for Windows which can be easily installed and used having mostly the same user experience one would get on Linux or Mac OSX. The rewrite aims to maintain command-line tool backward compatibility as a drop-in replacement for the legacy Python-based CloudMonkey (i.e. shell scripts using legacy CloudMonkey can also use the modern CloudMonkey cmk). Legacy Python-based CloudMonkey will continue to be available for installation via pip but it will not be maintained moving forward.<br>CloudMonkey 6.0 requires a final round of testing and bug-fixing before the release process will commence. The beta binaries are available for testing <a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.<br><br><b># Major changes in CloudMonkey 6.0</b><br>- Ships as standalone 32-bit and 64-bit binaries targeting Windows, Linux and Mac including ARM support (for example, to run on Raspberry Pi)<br>- Drop-in replacement for legacy Python-based CloudMonkey as a command line tool<br>- Interactive selection of API commands, arguments, and argument options<br>- JSON is the default API response output format<br>- Improved help docs output when ‘-h’ is passed to an API command<br>- Added new output format ‘column’ that outputs API response in a new columnar way like modern CLIs such as kubectl and docker<br>- Added new set option ‘debug’ to enable debug mode, set option ‘display’ renamed as ‘output’<br>- New CloudMonkey configuration file locking mechanism to avoid file corruption when multiple cmk instances run<br>- New configuration folder ~/.cmk to avoid conflict with legacy Python-based version<br><br><br><b># Features removed in CloudMonkey 6.0:</b><br>- Removed XML output format.<br>- Removed CloudMonkey logging API requests and responses to a file.<br>- Coloured output removed.<br>- Removed set options: color (for coloured output), signatureversion and expires (no longer acceptable API parameters), paramcompletion (API parameter completion is not enabled by default), cache_file (the default cache file, now at ~/.cmk/cache ), history_file (the history file), log_file (API log file).]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, a number of security flaws were recently found in the DNSMasq tool. This tool is used by many systems to provide DNS and DHCP services, including by the CloudStack System VMs.</p><p>According to Google’s investigation into the software, out of seven issues, three — CVE-2017-14491, CVE-2017-14492, and CVE-2017-14493 — are remote code execution flaws caused by heap buffer overflow and stack buffer overflow errors through DHCP and DNS vectors.</p><p>Another issue, CVE-2017-14494, can be exploited to bypass the Address space layout randomization (ASLR) memory protection function, leading to information leaks.</p><p>In addition, three more bugs, CVE-2017-14495, CVE-2017-14496, and CVE-2017-13704, can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks caused by invalid boundary checks, bug collision, and a coding issue.</p><h2>Affect On CloudStack</h2><p>CloudStack’s System VMs use DNSMasq to provide DNS and DHCP services to the guest VMs from the virtual routers.  These services are only exposed on the internal guest interface(s) of the virtual routers. Therefore a malicious user could compromise a virtual router to which they have a guest instance attached.</p><h2>The Fix</h2><p>On 9th October, an updated version of DNSMasq was released by the authors of DNSMasq for the Debian Wheezy Operating System which the CloudStack System VMs use.  We have created new versions of the System VM templates which should be used to replace your existing System VMs using the procedure described below.</p><p>A short-term fix for currently running System VMs (if they have internet access) is to log into the System VMs and run:</p><code>apt-get update <br>apt-get upgrade dnsmasq -y</code><p>For information on logging into System VMs please see: http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/latest/administration_guide.html?#accessing-system-vms</p><p>The above procedure will patch existing virtual routers, but should a virtual router be destroyed and recreated or a new virtual router created, the subsequent virtual router will no longer be patched.</p><p>The full fix is to replace the existing System VM template(s) with the latest patched versions as well as recreating or patch existing virtual routers.</p><h2>System VM Patching Procedure</h2><p>New System VM templates with updated DNSMasq for major CloudStack versions for XenServer, VMware and KVM hypervisors have been built. We advise CloudStack users to upgrade to the appropriate System VM template and either;</p><p>Patch all existing virtual routers using the procedure above or recreate all virtual routers using the procedure detailed in the link for updating system VM templates (below)<br>For ACS 4.10+: http://download.cloudstack.org/systemvm/4.10/dnsmasq/<br>For ACS 4.6-4.9: http://download.cloudstack.org/systemvm/4.6/dnsmasq/</p><p>The procedure for updating the system VM templates can be found at http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/projects/cloudstack-administration/en/latest/systemvm.html#enhanced-upgrade-for-virtual-routers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Today I sent out two CloudStack-related security advisories: CVE-2015-3251 (related to VM credential exposure) and CVE-2015-3252 (related to VNC authentication).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I sent out two CloudStack-related security advisories: CVE-2015-3251 (related to VM credential exposure) and CVE-2015-3252 (related to VNC authentication). Details about these issues can be found on the CloudStack user and dev mailing lists, as well as on the Full Disclosure and BUGTRAQ security mailing lists.</p><p>While these vulnerabilities are of moderate and low severity (respectively), the reason for this post is because the advisories were announced approximately 5 months after the first release of the patches in 4.5.2. This is personally embarrassing, unacceptable, and in a more severe case could be downright dangerous.</p><h2>What happened?</h2><p>The CloudStack security team worked through the related vulnerabilities through the summer of 2015. We had advisory drafts, patches, and mitigations all ready well before the release. Far enough ahead, actually, that we forgot about the release and weren't paying attention to the release (at least I wasn't - I know others were), and didn't send out the advisories at the appropriate time. Part of this is due to me having become an unofficial lead/spokesperson for the security team; In the past there has been at least one occasion when others released advisories when I was not available, but usually I'm coordinating issues and publishing announcements.</p><p>Luckily, the CloudStack Security Team works with and under the direction of the ASF security team. During one of their periodic reviews, they noticed CloudStack had loose ends on these two advisories, and asked for an update. Earlier today I realized the advisories had not been released, so here we are. </p><h2>How will we improve?</h2><p>Obviously, we don't want to be in this situation again. Here's some steps we're taking to minimize the chance of a repeat performance:</p><ul><li> I've modified the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Release+Procedure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Release Procedure</a> to specifically request the release manager give the security team a heads up that a release is about to be announced. This can be a simple non-blocking email that shouldn't slow down the release process, but still ensure that we're aware of the upcoming release.</li><li>I'll be ensuring that other members of the security team feel comfortable crafting and releasing advisories. Like the rest of CloudStack and other ASF projects, the CloudStack security team does not have a named leader and should be able to operate if I or others are unavailable.</li></ul><p>In the past I've referred to CloudStack as "critical infrastructure" - CloudStack powers infrastructure clouds for many large cloud providers. We take information security seriously, realizing that many depend upon our work. Vulnerabilities happen in most software at some point in time - the important part is how they are responded to. While in this case we did respond quickly to the issues and created and applied patches, we let the community down by not quickly releasing the advisories. This is an unfortunate chink in our armor, but we'll be taking steps to ensure it doesn't happen again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>UPDATE 1:</b> The instructions below are incomplete. The proper upgrade command is "apt-get install openssl libssl1.0.0". If you've just updated openssl, please go back and update libssl as well.<br><b>UPDATE 2:</b> Adding instructions for VMWare-hosted System VMs (Thanks to Geoff Higginbottom at ShapeBlue)<br><b>UPDATE 3:</b> Added instructions for verification of correct versions installed<br><b>UPDATE 4:</b> Apache CloudStack 4.0-4.1 not vulnerable, they use older Debian/openssl.<br><p>Earlier this week, a security vulnerability was disclosed in OpenSSL, one of the software libraries that Apache CloudStack uses to encrypt data sent over network connections. As the vulnerability has existed in OpenSSL since early 2012, System VMs in Apache CloudStack versions 4.1.1-4.3 are running software using vulnerable versions of OpenSSL. This includes CloudStack's Virtual Router VMs, Console Proxy VMs, and Secondary Storage VMs.</p><p>We are actively working on creating updated System VM templates for each recent version of Apache CloudStack, and for each of the hypervisor platforms which Apache CloudStack supports. Due to our testing and QA processes, this will take several days. In the meantime, we want to provide our users with a temporary workaround for currently running System VMs.</p><p>If you are running Apache CloudStack 4.0.0-incubating through the recent 4.3 release, the following steps will help ensure the security of your cloud infrastructure until an updated version of the System VM template is available:</p><h2> For KVM/Xen hosted systems</h2><ol><li> As an administrator in the CloudStack web UI, navigate to Infrastructure-&gt;System VMs</li><li> For each System VM listed, note the host it is running on, and it’s “Link Local IP address."</li><li> With that data, perform the following steps for each System VM:<ol type="a"><li> ssh into that host as root</li><li> From the host, ssh into the SSVM via it’s link local IP address: (e.g. ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.cloud -p 3922 169.254.3.33)</li><li> On the System VM, first run "apt-get update"</li><li> Then run apt-get install "openssl libssl1.0.0". If a dialog appears asking to restart programs, accept it’s request.</li><li> Next, for Secondary Storage VMs, run /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</li><li> Log out of the System VM and host server</li></ol></li><li>Back in the CloudStack UI, now navigate to Infrastructure-&gt;Virtual Routers. For each VR, host it's running on and it's link local IP address, and then repeat steps a-f above.</li></ol><h2> For VMWare hosted systems</h2><ol><li> As an administrator in the CloudStack web UI, navigate to Infrastructure-&gt;System VMs</li><li> For each System VM listed, note it's management IP address</li><li> With that data, perform the following steps for each System VM:</li><li> From the Management Server, ssh to the System VM via it's management IP: (eg ssh -i /var/lib/cloud/management/.ssh/id_rsa -p 3922 root@10.40.50.8)</li><li> On the System VM, first run "apt-get update"</li><li> Then run apt-get install "openssl libssl1.0.0". If a dialog appears asking to restart programs, accept it’s request.</li><li> Next, for Secondary Storage VMs, run /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</li><li> Log out of the System VM</li><li>Back in the CloudStack UI, now navigate to Infrastructure-&gt;Virtual Routers. For each VR, host it's running on and it's link local IP address, and then repeat steps a-f above.</li></ol><h2>Verification</h2><p>On each System VM, you can test if it has non-vulnerable openssl packages installed by listing installed packages and looking at the installed versions of openssl and libssl. As in the example below, for a system to be non-vulnerable, the packages need to be at or above version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u6:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">root@v-14-VM:~# dpkg -l|grep ssl ii  libssl1.0.0:i386                     1.0.1e-2+deb7u6                  i386         SSL shared libraries ii  openssl                              1.0.1e-2+deb7u6                  i386         Secure Socket Layer (SSL) binary and related cryptographic tools</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>We realize that for larger installations where System VMs are being actively created and destroyed based on customer demand, this is a very rough stop-gap. The Apache CloudStack security team is actively working on a more permanent fix and will be releasing that to the community as soon as possible.</p><p>For Apache CloudStack installations that secure the web-based user-interface with SSL, these may also be vulnerable to HeartBleed, but that is outside the scope of this blog post. We recommend testing your installation with [1] to determine if you need to patch/upgrade the SSL library used by any web servers (or other SSL-based services) you use.</p><a href="http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/</a>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently the Apache CloudStack PMC was informed that the realhostip.com Dynamic DNS service that CloudStack currently uses as part of the console proxy will be disbanded this summer.  The realhostip service will be <b>shut down June 30th, 2014, meaning users have approximately 3 months to mitigate this</b>.</p><p>Prior to version 4.3, CloudStack used the realhostip.com service by default. With the release of CloudStack version 4.3 the default communication method with the console proxy is plaintext HTTP.</p><h3>Who is Affected</h3><p>CloudStack installations prior to version 4.3 that have not been reconfigured to use a DNS domain other than realhostip.com for Console Proxy or Secondary Storage must make changes to continue functioning past June 30th, 2014.</p><h3>Steps You Need to Take</h3><p>If you meet the criteria above, there are several options to prepare for realhostip retirement:</p><ul><li> Set up wildcard SSL certificate and DNS entries: This method is already well supported within prior versions of CloudStack.</li><li> Upgrade to CloudStack 4.3 and disable SSL: This is only recommended for development installations, or private clouds that contain no information of importance.</li><li> Upgrade to CloudStack 4.3, set up static SSL certificate and configure load balancer to point to the correct IP address: While this allows an administrator to skip setting up the DNS entries from the previous option, it is a more advanced option as CloudStack 4.3 does not support automatic load balancer configuration for the Console Proxy. It is hoped this functionality will be available in future releases.</li></ul><p><b>For instructions</b> on how to set up SSL encryption for use with CloudStack console proxy, please read the <a href="http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/projects/cloudstack-administration/en/latest/systemvm.html#console-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">console proxy section of the CloudStack administration guide</a>.</p><p>Additionally, if you will be using an SSL vendor who requires an intermediate CA chain to be installed for proper SSL validation by web browsers, detailed instructions for configuring the intermediate CA chain in CloudStack can be found <a href="http://www.chipchilders.com/blog/2013/1/2/undocumented-feature-using-certificate-chains-in-cloudstack.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p><i>The Apache CloudStack security team does not recommend running a production cloud with either the realhostip.com SSL certificate, or with no SSL encryption at all.</i></p>]]></content:encoded>

With this major release many new and existing features need the blocker and critical bugs cleared out as soon as possible. There's been great teamwork in the community. <a href="http://markmail.org/message/gurcwi24lhfwut7s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Animesh Chaturvedi points out the work that still needs to be done</a>:</p><blockquote><p>...For the days remaining to code freeze, lets prioritize fixing blockers and critical over majors.

We currently have that term defined as:</p><p>Lazy Consensus - Lazy consensus requires 3 binding +1 votes and no binding -1 votes.</p><p>I'd like to propose that we change the PMC and Committer voting rule to use the Lazy 2/3 Majority approach defined as:</p><p>Lazy 2/3 majority votes requires at least 3 binding votes and twice as many binding +1 votes as binding -1 votes. <br>...</p></blockquote><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-24July2013-PossiblyEndingtheIRCChats"></a>Possibly Ending the IRC Chats</h5><p>After low attendance in weekly IRC chats, Joe Brockmeier has raised the question about the <a href="http://markmail.org/message/n7ex7rdvfguhwylr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">need for regular IRC chats</a>. IRC chats have been in place for a long time with the community. Make sure to stay involved with the discussion and let your voice be heard.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-24July2013-HowYourCodingMayAffectOthers"></a>How Your Coding May Affect Others</h5><p>Brian Federle noticed when working on the GUI code in Master <a href="http://markmail.org/message/ki42u4n6i7mbjaj4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">recently that the tab style had changed</a>. This started a large rebase and merge of the UI code of other developers in the community. While the original commit had the best intention and was committed correctly for 4.3, the review and commit were done within a short time frame and didn't give the community much time to see it and understand the impact. Make sure to communicate and be aware of what impacts your code might have on others working on the same objects as you. </p><p>Chip Childers pointed out:</p><blockquote><p>...that sweeping changes like this (or architectural changes as well) are best done <b>early</b> in a release cycle. The challenge we've run into here is that while 4.2 work is proceeding, master is open for 4.3 changes (and there is a preference that if something big is going to come in, nows the time to do it).</p></blockquote><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-24July2013-NewComponentsinJIRA"></a>New Components in JIRA</h5><p>To help clarify better on what a bug is all about, and to get it to the right visibility on it, <a href="http://markmail.org/message/tc74y3fqs27tu6uy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Prasanna Santhanam and Animesh Chaturvedi</a> have added several new component fields in JIRA to help with bug distinction.

If you would like to participate please reach out to Gregg on the Dev or User lists.</p><blockquote><p>The last video I plan on making this summer is a short video featuring some<br>of the coolest clouds and I am hoping you all will help me since we are all<br>so spread out.</p><p>Here is what I am needing to make this project a success:   A webcam<br>interview of you (questions below) and screen casts/capture of your cloud<br>in action.</p><p>Because my fellowship ends August 9th I will need this information by no<br>later than the <b>29th of July.</b>  </p><p>While I appreciate how busy all of you are, I am hoping you can carve a few<br>moments out of a day this week and complete the questions and capture some<br>of your cloud.  If you need any assistance in either capturing video<br>interviews or screens please let me know and I can help you.</p><p>This project is a great way to get your project some more visibility and I<br>thank you in advance for any help you can provide.

This week, we're taking a look at some of the interesting discussions going on in the community about the next generation of Apache CloudStack, and functionality we can provide, as well as procedural changes that everyone should be aware of. </p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-10July2013-NewsMovingtoWednesdays"></a>News Moving to Wednesdays</h3><p>To help get information out a little more timely to key discussions and information that is going on in the community we are going to move the publishing of the weekly news to Wednesdays, starting with this issue on July 10th! If you'd like to help put the news together, please sign up for the marketing@cloudstack.apache.org mailing list and ask how you can get involved!</p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-10July2013-MajorDiscussions"></a>Major Discussions</h3><p>In this section we look at major discussions that have happened on the CloudStack mailing lists. This is by no means a full summary of all discussions on the lists, but we try to hit the highlights that are relevant to the larger CloudStack community. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-10July2013-4.2StatusUpdate"></a>4.2 Status Update</h5><p>Animesh Chaturvedi is tracking the <a href="http://markmail.org/message/snon6ljkti6fgq4k" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">current status of the release</a>. Testing, bug fix work, and documentation should be targeted to complete by code freeze on 7/28. Release is still on schedule to release by 8/19.</p><blockquote><p>We are now just 3 weeks from ACS 4.2 code freeze on 7/29. We have around 400 open defects with 100+ blockers and critical and I expect another 200 new defects to come in. As a community we have been fixing roughly 100 defects per week, in order to clear up our backlog I request you to help out on aggressively fixing the issues. The unassigned issue list is available at <a href="http://s.apache.org/BlH/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">http://s.apache.org/BlH/</a>. When you fix a bug in 4.2 please make sure it is also fixed in master.</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">&lt;p&gt;Given the debate on system template changes in last few days of 4.1 requiring big testing effort and potential regression, I would like to see that as community we lock down system templates for 4.2 pretty soon.

to the object store refactor</a>. There's been a fair amount of discussion on how an extant feature could be broken without being exposed via testing, and what should be done about it at this stage. </p><p>David Nalley says that "unplanned/unannounced deprecation of a feature is a blocker IMO. It engenders a bad relationship with our users, and strands them on previous versions with no good migration/upgrade path." Chip Childers <a href="http://markmail.org/message/jgci4s7afqi6ix4u" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">says that</a> "I believe that this was an honest mistake, but we need to figure out what to do. I'm -1 on us saying 'we'll drop Swift support'. If necessary, I'd say that we need to roll back the object-store branch merge... I don't want to see that happen, though. That's why I'm asking about the effort to fix it."</p><p>Chip <a href="http://markmail.org/message/r3rqsxnrsvjm7gwx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">opened CLOUDSTACK-3400</a> as a blocker against 4.2 until Swift support is fixed.

There's been a lot of discussion on this topic. We would probably look to start this in the next release if it can come to a vote. </p><blockquote><p>Since we have adopted Semantic Versioning [<a href="http://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>], it seems odd that we designate a release version before the final set of enhancements/fixes has been identified.  For example, the release proceeding 4.2 may contain no backwards compatible API changes to be 4.3.  Conversely, we may decide during the development cycle, as a community, to accept a non-backwards compatible change which would bump the version to 5.0.0.  As such, it is difficult to know in advance what the proper semantic version number will be at when the work is released.  We run the risk of confusing our users if we start calling a pending release say 4.3.0, and accept a change mid-cycle that will bump it to 5.0.0.  To address this potential issue, I proposed that we refer to releases by a codename until feature freeze when we understand the complete scope of change and can apply the correct semantic version number.  I further propose we codename the release directly proceeding 4.2 "Gamma Rays" or "Gamma Rays Gonna Get Ya".  </p></blockquote><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-10July2013-CloudStackPlanet"></a>CloudStack Planet</h3><p>What's going on in the CloudStack community?

Ilya Musayev is the release manager for the 4.1.x branch, and has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/6ionwrcqlh4pi2j4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">asked</a> work all merges to be completed. Once that is done, he will call for a VOTE.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1July2013-LargeMerge%2FReleaseWork"></a>Large Merge / Release Work</h5><p>As we seen in the past and now again in 4.2, it's important to focus on merging your features early and often. By breaking up large merge and code review requests it is possible to help keep releases on schedule, get features in before the freeze and avoid Veto votes. Alex Huang and Kelven Yang worked really hard on a new and large VMSync feature that many users need. Because it came in so close to freeze and was a large merge request with less than a week before freeze it immediately received Veto votes blocking the merge. Even with the help of several other committers the review couldn't be done in a timely fashion and miss the 4.2 cutoff.</p><p>When late requests come in like this it also puts undo stress on the testing of the release as well. Read through the <a href="http://markmail.org/message/zgwtc5nzm3bpmic2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">merge thread</a> to follow the discussion on how we can improve this in the future.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1July2013-BVTAutomationTestingBreaks"></a>BVT Automation Testing Breaks</h5><p>After complaints that the BVT environment was broken, Alex Huang did some investigating to identify the root cause and raise a suggest on how BVT testing should be <a href="http://markmail.org/message/si6rt2mkc7dt4krw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">dealt with in the future</a>. </p><blockquote><p>After Dave's complain in the vmsync <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CLOUDSTACK&amp;title=MERGE&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=31825135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="createlink">MERGE</a> thread about BVT in horrible shape on master, I went around to figure out what exactly happened.  The best I can figure is that after a certain merge (I will leave out which merge as that's not important), BVT no longer runs automatically.  It was promised to be fixed and there are people who are actively fixing it but it's been in this way for about two weeks.  People running BVTs are working around the problem but it's not automated anymore and so it's no longer running on master.  I understand people are nice and tried to be accommodating to other people by working around the problem but sometimes we just have to be an arse.  So let me be that arse...</p><p>New Rule....<br>If BVT or automated regression tests break on master or any release branch, we revert all commits that broke it.  It doesn't matter if they promise to fix it within the next hour.  If it's broken, the release manager will revert the commits and developers must resubmit.  It sounds mean but it's the only way this problem can be fixed.  </p><p>To avoid having a bunch of reverts and resubmits, the developers should be able to request that BVT run on their branch and don't merge until BVT on their branch is at 100%.  We will work on figuring out how to do that.</p></blockquote><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1July2013-CloudMonkeyandPyPIReleases"></a>CloudMonkey and PyPI Releases</h5><p>On June 9th, Rohit Yadav asked about a problem with the 4.1.0-0 CloudMonkey release on PyPI lacking the fail safe API cache.

This week we welcome another new committer, work continues on 4.1.1 and 4.2.0, and we have some interesting discussions on how we should release the CloudMonkey and Marvin tools used with CloudStack. We've also seen a few interesting marketing discussions, and the community is gearing up for the second <a href="http://cloudstackcollab.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">CloudStack Collaboration Conference</a> taking place 23 June through 25 June in Santa Clara, CA.</p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-17June2013-MajorDiscussions"></a>Major Discussions</h3><p>In this section we look at major discussions that have happened on the CloudStack mailing lists. This is by no means a full summary of all discussions on the lists, but we try to hit the highlights that are relevant to the larger CloudStack community. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-17June2013-Progresson4.1.1Release"></a>Progress on 4.1.1 Release</h5><p>With 4.1 now released we are already beginning work on the 4.1.1 patch update. Ilya Musayev is release manager for the 4.1.x branch, but Chip Childers <a href="http://markmail.org/message/6ionwrcqlh4pi2j4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">will handle the 4.1.1 release</a> as Ilya is unavailable during the timeframe we expect to finish 4.1.1 and call for a VOTE.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-17June2013-CloudMonkeyandPyPIReleases"></a>CloudMonkey and PyPI Releases</h5><p>On June 9th, Rohit Yadav asked about a problem with the 4.1.0-0 CloudMonkey release on PyPI lacking the failsafe API cache:</p><blockquote><p>When I install it I don't get any api commands. The autodiscovery using sync is useful but only with the ApiDiscovery plugin which works only for 4.2 and later. For 4.1 and below I think we should, in that case, bundle the cache for all the apis. Or maybe<br>just oss components/plugins?</p></blockquote><p>David replied that "this is exactly why I've been <a href="http://markmail.org/message/wir5vfawex3y22ot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">suggesting that we break CloudMonkey (and Marvin) out of the main repo</a>" and give them their own lifecycle. "It's far easier/faster to iterate cloudmonkey than all of CloudStack and tying it to the slower lifecycle of ACS will continue to trouble it IMO."</p><p>Rohit replied that "we should do it then." Prasanna Santhanam replied, "I haven't given breaking out the project much thought. But it's certainly a possibility." However, Prasanna <a href="http://markmail.org/message/vq3sqf7o3nckdy5p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">notes that</a> "parts of the codebase" depend on Marvin, and it would require an "easier way to update Marvin across CloudStack providers to enable auto-updating Marvin's libraries like CloudMonkey can." </p><p>No final decisions have been made, but the discussion is still open for anyone that has a stake in how releases happen for Marvin and CloudMonkey.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-17June2013-CloudStackCommunitySurveyUnderway"></a>CloudStack Community Survey Underway</h5><p>Please let your voice and your organization be heard in this short survey.

The release includes many new features and bugfixes from the 4.0.x cycle. The 4.1.0 release also marks major changes in the codebase to make CloudStack easier for developers, a new structure for creating RPM/Debian packages, and completes the changeover to using Maven as a build tool.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="newfeatures">New Features<a href="#newfeatures" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Features" title="Direct link to New Features">​</a></h2><p>Some of the notable new features in Apache CloudStack 4.1.0 include:</p><ul><li>An API discovery service that allows an end point to list its supported APIs and their details.</li><li>Added an Events Framework to CloudStack to provide an “event bus” with publish, subscribe, and unsubscribe semantics.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, we had discussions about the release cycle and whether a six-month cycle may be more appropriate. Work continued on the 4.1.0 release, and Apache CloudStack 4.0.2 was released. </p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-MajorDiscussions"></a>Major Discussions</h3><p>Several major discussions this week, summarized below. Note that this is only a fraction of the activity in the project. For a full overview of project activity, you may want to subscribe to dev@cloudstack.apache.org. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-ReleaseCycle%3AFourMonths%2CorSix%3F"></a>Release Cycle: Four Months, or Six?</h5><p>Animesh Chaturvedi <a href="http://markmail.org/message/3ctdwor5hfbpa3vx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">started new thread for a discussion that cropped up in the timeline thread</a> about the four-month vs. six-month release cycle ideas. After much discussion, <a href="http://markmail.org/message/rqqbtbumx6xnzrcr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Animesh summed up the discussion</a> saying:</p><blockquote><p>I still see there is difference of opinion and not a clear consensus with 12 out<br>of 21 ( approx. 60%) preferring 6 months.  But going by the argument of not<br>having given proper shot to 4 month cycle I will say we can keep 4.2 as a 4<br>month cycle and pull in all effort to make it successful.  If it turns out that<br>we can work with 4 month schedule that's well and good otherwise we can bring<br>this topic again based on the results of running 4 month cycle.</p></blockquote><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-4.1.0Approaches"></a>4.1.0 Approaches</h5><p>After clearing out a number of last-minute blockers, it looks like 4.1.0 may be just about ready to roll. Chip Childers <a href="http://markmail.org/message/fe44ea4vy4yughwm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">posted on Friday</a> that he was waiting on confirmation on CLOUDSTACK-528 and CLOUDSTACK-2194 being fixed. If those are fixed, Chip says he will "proceed with starting the VOTE thread" Monday morning, Eastern time. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-ApacheCloudStack4.0.2Released"></a>Apache CloudStack 4.0.2 Released </h5><p>Joe Brockmeier <a href="http://markmail.org/message/vyukwk2nof5gaqko" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">announced the 4.0.2 release</a> on 24 April, along with security fixes for two security vulnerabilities. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-SecurityVulnerabilitiesinCloudStack4.0.x"></a>Security Vulnerabilities in CloudStack 4.0.x</h5><p>John Kinsella <a href="http://markmail.org/message/36mipmcuj7ryo7py" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">sent out an announcement detailing two security vulnerabilities</a> on 24 April:</p><blockquote><p>Description:<br>The CloudStack PMC was notified of two issues found in Apache CloudStack:</p><p>1) An attacker with knowledge of CloudStack source code could gain<br>unauthorized access to the console of another tenant's VM.</p><p>2) Insecure hash values may lead to information disclosure. URLs<br>generated by Apache CloudStack to provide console access to virtual<br>machines contained a hash of a predictable sequence, the hash of<br>which was generated with a weak algorithm. While not easy to leverage,<br>this may allow a malicious user to gain unauthorized console access.</p><p>Mitigation:<br>Updating to Apache CloudStack versions 4.0.2 or higher will mitigate<br>these vulnerabilities.</p><p>Credit:<br>These issues were identified by Wolfram Schlich and Mathijs Schmittmann<br>to the Citrix security team, who in turn notified the Apache<br>CloudStack PMC.</p></blockquote><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-ExposingAPIsthatcarryPOSTdata"></a>Exposing APIs that carry POST data</h5><p>Prasanna Santhanam <a href="http://markmail.org/message/ji4d23xozub3nehi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">raised a discussion</a> about adding the ability to send user data as POST to commands. </p><blockquote><p>I'm guessing we'll have to put in additional annotations on our APIs<br>that support POST so that API discovery can print the methods<br>supported (GET/POST). Right now it's only the deployVMCmd (AFAIK). But<br>I expect this will need to be done for others soon.</p><p>I've included POST support for <em>every</em> command in marvin but that's<br>just brute-force. To make it more intelligent I think we should apply<br>it to only apis that make sense as POST (causing side-effects). But<br>that needs to be exposed by the api endpoint.</p></blockquote><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-EnablingGitHubPullRequestNotification"></a>Enabling GitHub Pull Request Notification</h5><p>A discussion was brought up on dev@ this weekend about enabling notifications for pull requests made via GitHub. David Nalley <a href="http://markmail.org/message/f6cmckyakfa6sof4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">remarked</a> that in his opinion, "there really isn't an option - if we are going to have a GitHub mirror, we also need to be able to deal with the pull requests there. Ignoring folks that submit pull requests is inappropriate."</p><p>Chip <a href="http://markmail.org/message/vwyio3i5merrwrv5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">questioned the need for a GitHub mirror at all</a>. "Not sure the value, when you consider the confusion it causes WRT the canonical source repo."</p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-CloudStackPlanetPostsfromtheCloudStackCommunity"></a>CloudStack Planet - Posts from the CloudStack Community</h3><ul><li><b><a href="http://kirkjantzer.blogspot.com/2013/04/more-fun-with-cloudstack-api.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">More Fun with the CloudStack API</a></b> - Kirk Jantzer writes about playing with the CloudStack API and writing a tool "in an effort to make deployment of a mass amount of servers with as little effort as possible."</li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="http://buildacloud.org/blog/257-doing-it-twice-write-it-down.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Doing it Twice?

The CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2013 <a href="http://markmail.org/message/uqj2nazm6dcpg7h7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">has been announced for June 23rd through 25th</a>. You'll also want to check in on the discussions about the length of the release cycle, Chip Childers and David Nalley appearing on FLOSS Weekly, and much more. </p><p>A lot has happened since the last issue of the CloudStack Weekly News, and not just because the community's been busy - we missed getting last week's issue out. Sorry about that! If you'd like to see consistent weekly delivery, check the end of the newsletter to see how you can help.</p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-22April2013-MajorDiscussions"></a>Major Discussions</h3><p>In this section, we summarize some of the more interesting discussions taking place in the CloudStack community. While we try to pull out the discussions that are "don't miss" discussions to anyone who's involved in using or contributing to CloudStack, it's a really good idea to <a href="http://cloudstack.apache.org/mailing-lists.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">make sure you're subscribed</a> to the mailing lists and follow along. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-22April2013-ReleaseSchedule"></a>Release Schedule</h5><p>Animesh Chaturvedi <a href="http://markmail.org/message/6suq2fhltdvgvcxd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">started a discussion last week</a> about the release schedule for 4.2.0, trying to nail down the specific dates for feature freeze, docs freeze, etc. That was <a href="http://markmail.org/message/cp23tewephjuxv7f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">accompanied by a question of whether we should consider a six-month cycle</a>. Ultimately, no resolution was reached on the schedule. </p><p>Animesh has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/3ctdwor5hfbpa3vx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">started a new thread to discuss the release cycle</a>.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-22April2013-EasierSimpleInstalls"></a>Easier Simple Installs</h5><p>David has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/zvo3t26zjvedblah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">started a conversation on dev@ about the ease, or lack thereof, of installing CloudStack</a>. David says, "what I want to do is get rid of sections 2-4 of the quick install guide, and replace it with - 'run this one or two lines worth of commands' (<a href="http://s.apache.org/runbook" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">http://s.apache.org/runbook</a>)." David describes what he'd like to see: </p><blockquote><p>The all-in-one installation process I'd like to see:</p><p>Install your host OS Install an meta-RPM/Deb that either (installs everything, or alternatively configures a repo - or just installs the repo and the stuff I need to install with) Run a command that activates one of these config tools - configures the machine, installs the packages I need, and gets me to the point where I'm ready to login and go through the beautiful new user gui setup stuff. </p></blockquote><p>No further comments on this so far. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-22April2013-DevelopingaStorageBackupObjectStorePluginFramework"></a>Developing a Storage Backup Object Store Plugin Framework</h5><p>Min Chin <a href="http://markmail.org/message/cspb6xweeupfvpit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">has proposed a storage backup object store plugin framework</a> that would "allow CloudStack to systematically manage and configure various types of backup data stores from different vendors, like NFS, S3, Swift, etc." Specifically, Min says:</p><blockquote><p>With this new plugin framework, we would like to achieve following functionalities: </p><p>1. Support different object store providers in a uniform and pluggable fashion. <br>2. Enable region wide object backup using S3-like object store. <br>3. Provide pluggable data motion strategies to handle data transfer from one data store to another data store. <br>4. Provide a scalable cache storage framework while moving data between primary storage and backup storage for certain hypervisor needs.  <br>5. Support flexible combinations of primary storage, secondary storage and hypervisors, such as (NFS, NFS, Xen), (NF3, S3, Vmware), (ISCSI, Swift, KVM), ..., etc.</p></blockquote><p>The FS is <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/CLOUDSTACK/storage-backup-object-store-plugin-framework.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">on the wiki</a>, and Min says in a follow-up that there's a plan to "provide a sample plugin implementation" for the work.</p><p>With regards to compatibility concerns, Edison Su <a href="http://markmail.org/message/sstnaimx62mnyles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">responds</a> that existing APIs "can still be wired to new code" so that they continue to work, but "we can mark them as deprecated in the API document." Edison also notes that it can co-exist with the existing deployments and upgrades from pre-4.2.0 versions to 4.2.0 if the feature is accepted.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-22April2013-VOTEsfor4.1.0and4.0.2"></a>VOTEs for 4.1.0 and 4.0.2</h5><p>After a couple of false starts, it looks like the third time is the charm for the 4.0.2 release. Joe Brockmeier <a href="http://markmail.org/message/nfe2lyxj4mjsmxdb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">started the third voting round on Saturday 20 April</a>, and it has quite a few +1 (binding) votes so far. Unless -1'ed by Tuesday morning, it will be ready for release. </p><p>Chip has also <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/vfcje3fs5ilvm47c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">started the first vote</a> for 4.1.0, which will be open for 72 hours - assuming no show-stopping defects are found, and it garners at least 3 +1 PMC votes. Note that <b>everyone</b> in the CloudStack community is encouraged to test out the release candidate and cast a vote, regardless of whether the vote is "binding" or not. More testing is always better, and an informed -1 from a non-PMC member isn't going to be ignored when deciding whether to release or not. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-22April2013-DomainAdminLimitations"></a>Domain Admin Limitations</h5><p>Pranav Saxena has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/ucxsapyannat2z6b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">raised a discussion about the limitations for DOMAIN admins</a>, and wonders "why hasn't the domain -admin been given the privilege of creating sub-child domains himself? Are there any concerns/threats because of which the current architecture doesn't serve this purpose?"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Apache CloudStack community has been heads-down for the last week working out the remaining bugs for the 4.1.0 release. Chatter on the dev@ mailing list has been a little muted, comparatively, but there's still plenty of interest in this week's roundup of major discussions and CloudStack community activity.</p><p>This week, we look at the outstanding issues for 4.1.0, a discussion about allowing multiple API names for the same API Cmd object, how to deal with tests that expect no database, and how ticket assignment should work. </p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-8April2013-MajorDiscussions"></a>Major Discussions</h3><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-8April2013-OutstandingWorkforthe4.1.0Release"></a>Outstanding Work for the 4.1.0 Release</h5><p>4.1.0 is getting close, but we're not quite there yet. Chip Childers sent out a <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/7igfqlwj3ornbwq7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">list of outstanding work</a> required for 4.1.0. Several of the issues are already in progress, but Chip also pointed out <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-1941" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">CLOUDSTACK-1941: Cannot delete users in the default admin account within the UI</a> as unassigned. This is a critical issue that will need to be addressed before an RC or release can be cut.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-8April2013-APINameAlias"></a>API Name Alias</h5><p>Kishan Kavala has raised a discussion <a href="http://markmail.org/message/5j6qhtyw53vxbnal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">about an API name alias</a>. Kishan has a plan to enhance the name parameter "to support comma separated values. This will allow multiple API names for the same API Cmd object." John Burwell <a href="http://markmail.org/message/zz5inlth3jtrpjok" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">recommended</a> using an array rather than a comma separated value, but there's been some discussion as to whether that's the best arrangement for the current code.</p><p>So far, the discussion has not come to a resolution. Folks who have an understanding of the impact or wish to comment on the feature should jump into the discussion on dev@.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-8April2013-DatabaseTestsandHittingMaster"></a>Database Tests and Hitting Master</h5><p>While the project works on finalizing 4.1.0, work continues on 4.2.0 and later releases in the master branch. This week there was another breakage in master, <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/sqxci3hswfmrionn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">and a discussion following about database access during tests</a>. One proposal was to disable the database before running tests, but this has been challenged as being overly complicated for developers who may be running CloudStack on their test machines and find it inconvenient to disable the db when running tests.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-8April2013-PreparingtheBoardReport"></a>Preparing the Board Report</h5><p>As an Incubating project, Apache CloudStack prepared a board report every three months, which would be reviewed by the IPMC and (if approved) sent up to the board as part of the Apache Incubator report.</p><p>Now that Apache CloudStack is a top-level project (TLP), it prepares its own report for the board. Chip Childers <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/s7sx3fgfkb6hsbqy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">started the discussion on the mailing list</a> with a draft of the report.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-8April2013-AssigningTickets"></a>Assigning Tickets </h5><p>Noah Slater <a href="http://markmail.org/message/ngt2o3wqh5fm6n6y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">raised an issue</a> about ticket assignments:</p><blockquote><p>Right now, we have people who are regularly going through JIRA and triaging tickets. This is totally fantastic, and a very valuable activity for the project. (So thank you!) But I also notice that specific individuals are being assigned to the tickets in the process.</p><p>This is a form of "cookie licking". The analogy is that if you fancy a cookie, but you're too hungry right now, you take a lick of it so nobody else can touch it. This is an anti-pattern and we should try to avoid it. </p></blockquote><p>As a result, Noah suggested that we change the way that ticket assignments are handled so that people are taking tickets as they get a chance to work on them, rather than taking tickets that they plan to work on. </p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-8April2013-CloudStackPlanetPostsfromtheCloudStackCommunity"></a>CloudStack Planet - Posts from the CloudStack Community</h3><ul><li>Chip Childers: "<a href="http://www.chipchilders.com/blog/2013/4/4/apache-cloudstack-graduation-news-roundup.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Apache CloudStack Graduation News Roundup</a>" Chip rounds up some of the reports on the Apache CloudStack graduation.</li></ul><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-8April2013-UpcomingEvents"></a>Upcoming Events</h3><ul><li><b>Open Cloud Challenges</b> at the Data Center Expo, Paris, April 10th <a href="http://www.datacenter-expo.com/info_event/80/cloud-open-source---les-communautes-open-cloud-et-leurs-defis.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Open Cloud</a>.</li><li><b>Cloud Computing</b> at the University of British Columbia (Robson Campus), Vancouver, Canada, April 9th.</li><li><b>CloudStack Introduction and Basics</b> - The inaugural meeting of the <a href="http://meetup.com/CloudStack-NYC-User-Group/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">CloudStack NYC User Group</a> will be Wednesday, April 10th in New York City. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CloudStack-NYC-User-Group/events/106104162/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Sign up on Meetup.com</a>.</li><li><b>UK/European CloudStack user group</b> <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5816841329/eorg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">meet-up</a> will be April 11th in London.</li><li><b>Storage in Apache CloudStack</b> being held by the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CloudStack-SF-Bay-Area-Users-Group/events/108916562/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">CloudStack SF Bay Area Users Group</a> on April 30, 2013 @ Citrix Conference Center, sign up on the Meetup.com Website.</li><li><b>CloudStack Bangalore Meetup</b> Sometime in April, date not yet announced.

            <description><![CDATA[Welcome to the April 1 issue of the Apache CloudStack Weekly News. Don't worry, no foolishness in this issue – just a quick recap of the week's most important events.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/img/imported/3b5a1e4e-90cb-469e-a58a-512bdcc28007"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/3b5a1e4e-90cb-469e-a58a-512bdcc28007?t=true" alt="acwn-icon.png" align="left" class="img_ev3q"></a>Welcome to the April 1 issue of the Apache CloudStack Weekly News. Don't worry, no foolishness in this issue – just a quick recap of the week's most important events. </p><p>As you recall, we officially announced that the CloudStack project was graduating from the incubator last week. Though there were no events quite of that magnitude this week, there was plenty of discussion of new features, a new Website design proposal, and Chiradeep Vittal has unveiled a new tool for testing and development called QuickCloud that will come in handy for many CloudStack contributors and users.</p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-MajorDiscussions"></a>Major Discussions</h3><p>This is a summary of some of the most interesting/important discussions on the Apache CloudStack mailing lists. (Mostly dev@cloudstack.apache.org, but not excluding discussions on marketing@ and users@, of course.) This is provided as a convenient summary for folks who are not involved in day-to-day development of Apache CloudStack – if you're working on CloudStack or would like to get involved in development, we highly recommend being subscribed to dev@cloudstack.apache.org and keeping close tabs on the list!</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-WebsiteReDesignDiscussion"></a>Website Re-Design Discussion</h5><p>Sonny Chhen has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/rfgclvkfz6qtgy33" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">submitted a second mock-up design for the front page of the Apache CloudStack Web site</a> which has been met with quite a lot of enthusiasm. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-Quickcloud:ZerotoCloudinLessthanaMinute!"></a>Quickcloud: Zero to Cloud in Less than a Minute! </h5><p>Chiradeep Vittal has developed Quickcloud, a <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/ajw7b6arhluqcuv2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">much easier way</a> to start up a CloudStack cloud on a single box. <a href="http://markmail.org/message/weqbozgay44v3bro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Chiradeep announced on March 26th that QuickCloud is in a "rough-but-ready state"</a> for developers to try out.  </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-EIPAcrossZones"></a>EIP Across Zones</h5><p>Discussion <a href="http://markmail.org/message/6licrw7dve4f674h" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">continued</a> on Murali Reddy's <a href="http://markmail.org/message/flx3romoalsu5oiu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">proposal</a> to enhance the EIP functionality to work at the region level. This week, Murali explained in more detail what he was thinking:</p><blockquote><p>CloudStack need not have a native capability to move IP across zone. From the CloudStack core perspective, all we need is abstraction of moving IP (presented as NAT) across the zones. Then we can have specific intelligence in the plug-ins which are providing EIP service. For e.g.'Route Health Injection' is commonly used solution in distributed data centres for disaster recovery supported by multiple vendors.</p></blockquote><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-UpgradeProcessfrom4.0.xto4.1.0"></a>Upgrade Process from 4.0.x to 4.1.0</h5><p>Wido den Hollander <a href="http://markmail.org/message/5at5p2hasjltkt5z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">started a discussion about how upgrades will work</a> for 4.0.x to 4.1.0, given the package renaming taking place in 4.1.0. See the discussion on the mailing list and <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Ubuntu+upgrade+process" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">docs in progress on the wiki</a>. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-ProposedFeatures:ACLonPrivateGatewayandEgressFirewallRulesforSRX"></a>Proposed Features: ACL on Private Gateway and Egress Firewall Rules for SRX</h5><p>Jayapal Reddy Uradi <a href="http://markmail.org/message/3p5gwarljkqxlf4m" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">has proposed a new feature ACL on the private gateway</a>. Says Jayapal, "Currently we do not have way to control the traffic on the private gateway. Using this feature we can configure the ingress/egress ACL on the private gateway." </p><p>Jayapal has also proposed <a href="http://markmail.org/message/e6yrbl2b7rehk2g4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">egress firewall rules for the external firewall device, SRX</a>. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-JenkinsUpgrade"></a>Jenkins Upgrade</h5><p>Prasanna Santhanam has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/h5dmrprwyswuq5fv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">pointed out a few bugs that were affecting build jobs</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Mature, open source turn-key platform for delivering scalable, full-featured Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds.</em></strong></p><p>Forest Hill, MD - 25 March 2013</p><p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of nearly 150 open source projects and initiatives, announced today that Apache CloudStack has graduated from the Apache Incubator to become a Top-Level Project (TLP), signifying that the project's community and products have been well-governed under the ASF's meritocratic process and principles.</p><p>"When CloudStack first became an Apache Incubator project, it was a well-established cloud management platform, so its codebase was already mature," said Chip Childers, Vice President of Apache CloudStack. "Our work in the Incubator has focused on growing a really strong community around the code and establishing the governance practices expected of a top-level project within the Apache Software Foundation."</p><p>Formerly the product of Cloud.com, which was acquired by Citrix in 2011, CloudStack was donated by Citrix to ASF and submitted to the Apache Incubator in April 2012. It is a well-established cloud management platform, already widely in production use by many organizations. It is used to deliver Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud computing in both private-cloud, public, and hybrid cloud environments. It has been proven to be both stable and highly scalable, underpinning production clouds more than 30,000 physical nodes, in geo-distributed environments.</p><p>Asked to comment on the importance of becoming a Top-Level Project, Childers added "CloudStack had the advantage of having many long-term, large deployments which had proven the stability and scalability of the technology. This helped us concentrate on adopting the 'Apache Way' of governance, which is well understood and open, delivering so many great pieces of software over the years."</p><p>"We know that Infrastructure-as-a-Service is the next generation of IT infrastructure, and that people will demand open standards and open governance for such an important layer in their IT stack. That is why the CloudStack project meeting the rigorous standards of ASF governance is so significant. "</p><p>When asked to comment on the Apache CloudStack community itself, Childers said: "we've managed to build a diverse, friendly and very open community around CloudStack. New members receive a really warm welcome and we make sure that all contributors are on an equal footing, whether they are writing code or helping with any other aspect of the project. Anybody thinking of getting involved in the project would quickly find what a great community we are. As well as online involvement, we've already had a global collaboration conference and there are many CloudStack groups established in many different countries. "</p><p><strong>About Apache CloudStack</strong></p><p>Apache CloudStack is a complete software suite for creating Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds. Target environments include service providers and enterprises. It is used by many service providers to set up an on-demand, elastic cloud computing services and by enterprises to set up a private cloud for use by their own employees. Apache CloudStack is also available to individuals and organizations that wish to study and implement an IaaS for personal, educational, and/or production use.</p><p>Further information on Apache CloudStack can be found at <a href="http://cloudstack.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloudstack.apache.org</a>.</p><p><strong>About Apache Software Foundation</strong></p><p>The Apache Software Foundation, a US 501(3)(c) non-profit corporation, provides organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range of over 140 open source software projects. The Foundation provides an established framework for intellectual property and financial contributions that simultaneously limits potential legal exposure for our project committers. Through a collaborative and meritocratic development process known as The Apache Way, Apache(tm) projects deliver enterprise-grade, freely available software products that attract large communities of users. The pragmatic Apache License makes it easy for all users, commercial and individual, to deploy Apache products. </p>]]></content:encoded>

To put it succinctly, Alex found that there are better ways to build CloudStack using Eclipse and Maven together, and has written a script to help developers speed up their tools.

This is an issue because CloudStack supports each account having their own private IP ranges and two accounts can use the same private IP range. For example, by default if you create a network with source nat and you do not specify any gateway or subnet data, it will give you 10.1.1.0/24 as an IP range. This means it will be very likely that two CloudStack accounts will be using the same private IP space.</p></blockquote><p>Alex <a href="http://markmail.org/message/iyydkgxzvbzmo4jw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">replied</a>, "There is a mode in CloudStack that only allows non-intersecting cidrs for guest networks. It was introduced specifically because many physical network devices do not expect cidrs to intersect even when it's on different VLANs."</p><p>Stuck on a technical issue?

Marcus says, "This patch disk has been bugging me for awhile, as it creates a volume<br>that isn't really tracked anywhere or known about in cloudstack's database. Up until recently these would just litter the KVM primary<br>storages, but there's been some triage done to attempt to clean them up when the system vms go away. It's not perfect. It also can be<br>inefficient for certain primary storage types, for example if you end up creating a bunch of 10MB luns on a SAN for these."</p><p>Later in the discussion, Edison Su responded to Marcus' approach to handling the issue. <a href="http://markmail.org/message/2ee2z7vfo6hoq45p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Edison says</a> "we put a lot of logic into init scripts inside system VM, which has unnecessarily complicated the system VM programming." Ultimately, Edison suggest that we may need "to start working on a new system VM programming model now? Better to just put a Python daemon inside system VM, and provide restful API through link local IP address(or private IP if it's vmware), then mgt server or hypervisor agent code can just send commands to the Python daemon through HTTP, instead of SSH."</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-11March2013-BuildVerificationTest%28BVT%29forCloudStackCheckins"></a>Build Verification Test (BVT) for CloudStack Checkins</h5><p>Alex Huang <a href="http://markmail.org/message/kvtkfjaswopqkd7m" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">proposed</a> building a BVT system to "ensure that checkins do not break the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CLOUDSTACK&amp;title=master&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=30756122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="createlink">master</a> branch." </p><p>After a fair amount of discussion, Chip Childers <a href="http://markmail.org/message/2tavrqatlyyrwmp6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">responded, saying that the first step to getting Gerrit</a> is "for us to agree to using it and to be able to clearly articulate <b>why</b>.  Without being able to explain our issue, we'll be questioned about jumping to a tool-based solution by the infra team."</p><p>The entire discussion is worth a read for anyone involved in day-to-day CloudStack development. (Indeed, one hopes that <b>all</b> developers have paid close attention to this thread, not only the handful of active voices who have jumped into the discussion.)</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-11March2013-ProposaltoRefactorApplianceBuildingCodeUndertools%2Fappliance"></a>Proposal to Refactor Appliance Building Code Under tools/appliance</h5><p>Rohit Yadav has proposed to "<a href="http://markmail.org/message/lmvbmqvuiriyfgij" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">fix/refactor devcloud appliance building scripts</a> from tools/devcloud/sr to tools/appliance" and "to create a new devcloud that has all the build tools, IDE and possibly a lightweight desktop environment or tiling window manager."</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-11March2013-IncrementalBuild"></a>Incremental Build</h5><p>Edison points out that <a href="http://markmail.org/message/a2b4tfrts3yyhary" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Maven 3 doesn't support incremental builds</a>, "so it takes a long time (4-7 minutes) to make a build" even with small changes in the source code.

We should probably distill this into a wiki page somewhere, but that's not done quite yet (volunteer?).  Keep in mind<br>that I've tried to pull the important parts of the conversation into this email...  it was a fairly long thread of discussion and debate.<br>I'd suggest reading it all the way to the end to form your own understanding of why we have to be careful about how we work as a community.</p><p>The TL;DR version:</p><p>The issue that we ran into with several features being developed "outside the community" for 4.1 was a major deal, and it had several<br>implications.  First, doing that effectively hurts our community.

The current setup, says Noa, has many problems. In response, Noa has started a proof-of-concept "of a replacement for this whole mess yesterday, a few tens of lines of code setting up an embedded jetty web container. A few lines of code to parse a config file, set up logging and spawn an embedded servlet container."</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4March2013-ChangingProjectBylawstoModifyPMCChairVotingProcessandTerm"></a>Changing Project Bylaws to Modify PMC Chair Voting Process and Term</h5><p>Chip kicked off a VOTE thread last week <a href="http://markmail.org/message/w6fn62vqsphyqd6q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">to modify the project bylaws slightly</a>:</p><blockquote><p>As <a href="http://markmail.org/message/ifwwce657u36yuwz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">previously discussed</a>, we'd like to make a <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Apache+CloudStack+Project+Bylaws" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">change to our bylaws</a> to modify the method of selecting a PMC chair.  We also want to add a term for the chair.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="http://markmail.org/message/sgqllgaogduwybhr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">text was clarified slightly</a> during the vote. The vote remains open until March 5.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4March2013-SupportLifetime"></a>Support Lifetime</h5><p>With the 4.1 release getting closer, David Nalley <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/a327j3vqw6pklhho" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">raised the topic of the support lifetime for releases</a>. Chip <a href="http://markmail.org/message/xvvudgauegit3j4t" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">proposed a model</a> that would consist of only bug fix releases for:</p><blockquote><ul class="alternate" type="square"><li>The latest feature release of our active major version number (i.e.: 4.x)</li><li>The latest feature release of our last major version number (doesn't exist today, but will be 4.x when / if we bump to 5.0)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Joe Brockmeier replied with a +1, saying that with the current level of participation in the bug-fix releases "this is the most realistic approach that's good for the community."</p><p>David asked whether an end of support means an end to bug fixes and security fixes at the same time. "Wearing your enterprise software consumer hat - does a supportlifetime of approximately 12 months make sense?" Instead, David proposed "we should add a month (so that EOL is one month after 4.n+2 releases, with the understanding that 4.n is likely to only receive security fixes if any during that extra one month window.)"</p><p>The discussion continues, so developers and users that have a vested interest in the support lifetime for ACS releases would do well to follow and respond to the discussion.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4March2013-APIThrottling"></a>API Throttling</h5><p>Parth Jagirdar has <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/nj75xlemzxcy5qr2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">started a discuss thread</a> about API throttling. "API throttling number can be set to anything at this point. Suggestions here is to have this number set to a value that is 'greater than' number of API that can be fired by any potential action on UI." (Note, Parth then sent out a follow-up email to correct the initial subject line from [DISCUSS} to <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CLOUDSTACK&amp;title=DISCUSS&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=30755264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="createlink">DISCUSS</a>, but all relevant discussion has happened in the original thread.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, interesting discussions on the Java version(s) to be supported by CloudStack, updates on translation, and database changes. Also discussion on the next CloudStack Collaboration Conference, and more. Work on 4.1.0 continues, and there's much to be done before it's ready to ship.</p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudstackWeeklyNews-25February2013-MajorDiscussionsandIssues"></a>Major Discussions and Issues</h3><p>Some of the major discussions and issues that have taken place on cloudstack-dev and cloudstack-users in the past week. This is by no means exhaustive, if you need to be up-to-date on all development issues in the project, you'll definitely want to be subscribed to the mailing lists!</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudstackWeeklyNews-25February2013-ScheduleReminder"></a>Schedule Reminder</h5><p>Chip Childers has sent out a <a href="http://markmail.org/message/z37xsunbtikzukzl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">friendly reminder</a> about the schedule: </p><blockquote><p> Thursday is the last day of this<br>phase of QA / bug-fix work.  We defined it as:</p><p>2013-02-28<br>Docs Completion Target (except release notes and translations) (Docs<br>may be included in the release after this date, after consensus on<br>each addition that the inclusion does not reduce release quality).</p><p>  Release Branch moves to limited updates only (only commits allowed<br>in would be release blockers fixes, translation updates, etc...)</p><p>I'd like to get as many bugs resolved as possible (as well as ensure<br>that the blockers that Sudha has shared this morning are addressed as<br>quickly as possible).</p><p>After Thursday, we're going to want to move to a very limited amount of<br>change within the 4.1 branch.  Given that, now's the time to knock down<br>the blockers...  but also as many of the other priority bugs as<br>possible.</p></blockquote><p>If you have 4.1 bugs on your plate, please be sure to try to either resolve them or at least triage/report status. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudstackWeeklyNews-25February2013-CloudStackCollaborationSummit"></a>CloudStack Collaboration Summit</h5><p>Mark Hinkle <a href="http://markmail.org/message/flbkomj6mvgvfsdx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">started a discussion about the next CloudStack Collaboration Conference</a>, offering to work on a proposal for an event in the spring and fall. Lots of folks have expressed interest, and suggested holding the spring event in Europe rather than North America.

The culprit? Seems to be that some changes have snuck in that want a later version of Java than is in Ubuntu 12.04.</p><p>No decision has been reached so far, but there is a case to be made that changing the Java version is a significant disruption to users.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudstackWeeklyNews-25February2013-TranslationUpdate"></a>Translation Update</h5><p>Sebastien Goasguen has sent out an <a href="http://markmail.org/message/wnkzas5bnd4t3fn6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">update</a></p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudstackWeeklyNews-25February2013-DiscussiononDatabaseChanges"></a>Discussion on Database Changes</h5><p>Last week Rohit Yadav <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp2AGii1szQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">had a Google+ hangout with Alex and Abhi</a> to discuss future of database deployment and upcoming work on creating a new tool called DatabaseCreator that will make database deployments easier. It was decided and enforced on 4.1 and master branch that:</p><ul><li>create-schema.sql ought not be changed from the version 4.0 schema</li><li>Any new additions should go into their correct upgrade paths, for 4.2 that would mean schema-410to420.sql and schema-410to420-cleanup.sql</li><li>It would do rolling upgrade from 4.0, this was enforced in DatabaseUpgradeChecker</li></ul><p>Once DatabaseCreator is implemented correctly for 4.2 release, a sysadmin will have power to work on their own upgrade strategies. The workflow would be:</p><ul><li>System admin uses the tool to take a db dump, upgrade the database, at this stage the new database should be backward compatible with old db.</li><li>Next all CloudStack management servers are upgraded.</li><li>The tool is called again to do sanity checks and cleanup any db schema.</li></ul><h5><a name="ApacheCloudstackWeeklyNews-25February2013-DevelopmentonDIYSystemVMtemplates"></a>Development on DIY SystemVM templates</h5><p>This week <a href="http://markmail.org/message/znflttrdsv3gtoh4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Rohit Yadav and Chiradeep</a> were finally able to configure a veewee project so systemvm template can be built on one's own box using veewee and VirtualBox, Rohit also created a systemvm building jenkins job. The source code exists in tools/appliance and has a README for folks to get started. The default template is based on Debian Wheezy but anyone can change the definition.rb, preseed.cfg and postinstall.sh script to fork their own systemvm templates based on Ubuntu, Fedora etc.</p><p>Rohit shared a <a href="http://rohityadav.in/logs/building-systemvms/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">post</a> with the issues and challenges of setting an <a href="http://jenkins.cloudstack.org/view/master/job/build-systemvm-master/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">automated jenkins build job</a> that would create systemvm appliances and export them to various virtual disk image formats.

This is by no means exhaustive, if you need to be up-to-date on all development issues in the project, you'll definitely want to be subscribed to the mailing lists!</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18February2013-QAScrumMeetingMinutes"></a>QA Scrum Meeting Minutes </h5><p><a href="http://markmail.org/message/fcjpe4z5bezfodmx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">The QA Scrum meeting minutes for 12 February 2013</a> sent to the mailing list.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18February2013-IRCMeetingMinutes"></a>IRC Meeting Minutes </h5><p>Summary of the <a href="http://markmail.org/message/solu2opycgkqb63x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">weekly IRC Meeting for 13 February 2013</a>. </p><p>Note that last week's meeting went in reverse alpha-order, but it was largely agreed during the meeting that we should have an agenda for the meeting. Please submit agenda items by Wednesday at 16:00 UTC.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18February2013-GraduationtoaTopLevelProject%28TLP%29%3F"></a>Graduation to a Top-Level Project (TLP)?</h5><p>Is Apache CloudStack ready to leave the incubator? <a href="http://markmail.org/message/3nluchj5q5waguws" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Chip Childers</a> raised the discussion on the -dev list on February 13th. </p><blockquote><p>My general impression is that we have come a long way as a community since CloudStack entered the incubator. While there are still rough edges for us to work through over time, we are dealing with our problems quite well as a community. The simple reason that I believe we are in a position to ask to graduate, is that we are no longer getting value from the incubation process!  That's a good thing, because it means that we have managed to learn quite a bit about the ASF processes, rules, methods and preferences.</p></blockquote><p>Marcus Sorensen <a href="http://markmail.org/message/l2kqj2gppghm4f2q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">agreed</a> that there are rough edges but, "the incubation process itself may not teach us anything further about these things, and they're just things we need to iron out over time."</p><p>David Nalley wrote:</p><blockquote><p>I don't see us actively receiving any benefit from continuing in incubation. We are far from perfect, but the project seems to be policing itself. So I am not seeing a huge incentive to staying.</p><p>There are also some downsides to remaining in incubation. First there's the label 'incubation' that follows almost everything we do, and is potentially off-putting to potential community members. Second as a community there are a number of things we can't do for ourselves, and thus have to ask permission or for help - this includes votes on releases, creating new user accounts, etc. I think of this as the overhead of being in the incubator.</p></blockquote><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18February2013-DiscussiononDatabaseChangesandMerges"></a>Discussion on Database Changes and Merges</h5><p>Rohit Yadav <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/z32xdbr2injgjrrp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">put out the word</a> that there were database changes ahead for the 4.1 branch and master. </p><p>Rohit also brought up a merge for <a href="http://markmail.org/message/2v3hqmanasol6okw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">database schemas for 4.1.0</a> and pointed to the <a href="http://people.apache.org/~bhaisaab/diff-create-schema-40-41.sql" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">current differences in the database schema for 4.1 over 4.0</a>.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18February2013-Documentationfor4.1"></a>Documentation for 4.1</h5><p>Sebastien Goasguen <a href="http://markmail.org/message/rjbctl6uu3qu2c7g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">started a thread on documentation for 4.1</a>, which is a must-read for anyone working on docs. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18February2013-HowtoTreatBrokenBuilds"></a>How to Treat Broken Builds</h5><p>David Nalley expressed some <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/bb7qgl3esc25cdek" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">frustration with the community's reaction to broken builds</a>. </p><blockquote><p>In general it seems we don't care, and this makes it more difficult to fix problems. Jenkins reporting a broken build (be it a broken run of RAT, failure to compile, failure of a unit test, building docs, etc.) should be our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andon_(manufacturing)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Andon cord</a>. We should all stop commits that aren't fixing the broken build. To illustrate why this is a problem, RAT failures started occurring recently, this keeps us from testing whether CloudStack builds, because each build is conditioned on the successful completion of the test before it. That in turn keeps apidocs from building,  which keeps marvin from building, which keeps documentation from building. We essentially are blind until it gets fixed.</p></blockquote><p>Marcus Sorensen asked <a href="http://markmail.org/message/2kjhnje2zgocobbt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">if there was a Jenkins report committers could subscribe to</a> in order to avoid the problem. David <a href="http://markmail.org/message/wcksnc2xqndyxjz6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">replied</a>, "Yes there are - the commits mailing list receives the notifications from both jenkins.cs.o and builds.a.o. ... You can subscribe by sending an email to cloudstack-commits-subscribe@incubator.apache.org."</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18February2013-WaitBeforeyouMerge%21"></a>Wait Before you Merge!</h5><p>How long should you wait until you merge into master or a branch? <a href="http://markmail.org/message/f6obhtciavb22ybx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Chip Childers</a> brought this up in response to a merge that was announced on February 12th and then committed on February 13th. This discussion raised the fact that <a href="http://markmail.org/message/mw7vvasrofpr7k3k" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">there's not a formal merge process</a> documented. Chip volunteered to take a crack at the document and asked for help "in getting it in shape to reflect consensus on the topic."</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18February2013-AndroidandiOSCloudStackClients"></a>Android and iOS CloudStack Clients</h5><p>Abhinandan Prateek <a href="http://markmail.org/message/m5tpje5wdgjzwuyn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">asked</a> about the utility of a Android and/or iOS client for CloudStack. David pointed out that <a href="https://github.com/creationline/cumulus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">an Android client called Cumulus</a> exists that is "pretty useful as an end-user, but less so as an admin." </p><p>Pranav Saxena <a href="http://markmail.org/message/judciif4hwyxmypg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">replied that</a> there was already some work underway off-list on a client using PhoneGap, and it might be possible to collaborate. (Ed. Note: This is why you should bring ideas to the list sooner rather than later, so there's not a wasted effort when two or more community members have the same idea and try to implement it separately.)</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18February2013-NewDependencyonOWASPESAPIforJava"></a>New Dependency on OWASP ESAPI for Java</h5><p>Likitha Shetty <a href="http://markmail.org/message/w5qdogojgrbxgi7x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">announced</a> a new dependency on the OWASP ESAPI for Java in master.</p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18February2013-UpcomingEvents"></a>Upcoming Events</h3><ul><li><a href="http://markmail.org/thread/frj26yjlgn7gty6x" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link"><b>CloudStack Meetup in San Jose</b></a> on February 20th.</li><li><b>PuppetCamp LA</b> on February 22nd.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the 4.0.1-incubating release of the CloudStack Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud orchestration platform. This is a minor release in the 4.0.0 branch, which contains fixes for more than 30 bugs.</p><p>Apache CloudStack is an integrated software platform that allows users to build a feature-rich IaaS. CloudStack includes an intuitive user interface and rich API for managing the compute, networking, accounting, and storage for private, hybrid, or public clouds. The project entered the Apache Incubator in April 2012.</p><p>The 4.0.1-incubating release includes fixes for a number of issues, including a minor security vulnerability (CVE-2012-5616), problems adding KVM hosts, fixes to documentation, and more. Please see the <a href="http://is.gd/acs401CHANGES" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHANGES</a> file in the release for a full list of issues that are fixed in this release. As a bugfix release, no new features are included in 4.0.1-incubating, and it should be a simple upgrade from 4.0.0-incubating.</p><h2>Downloads</h2><p>The official source code release can be downloaded from:</p><p><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/cloudstack/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://incubator.apache.org/cloudstack/downloads.html</a></p><p>In addition to the official source code release, individual contributors have also made convenience binaries available on the Apache CloudStack download page.</p><h2>Incubating</h2><p>Apache CloudStack is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

David Nalley pointed out that <a href="http://markmail.org/message/kitfyx5cqvyeopwl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">many of the problems Alex looks to solve with Gerrit are "social/cultural problems"</a> that a technical solution alone won't fix. </p><p>Hugo Trippaers also voiced concerns about implementing Gerrit, saying that "a formal process like Gerrit" isn't necessary. </p><blockquote><p>The committer status is granted based on the trust we put in a certain individuals to take care of the CloudStack project, for me that included taking the responsibility that any contributions are up to spec. I want to trust my fellow committers that they know what they are doing and i don't feel the need to second guess that by wanting to look over their code before they can commit it.</p></blockquote><h5><a name="ApacheCloudstackWeeklyNews-11February2013-Cloudinitvs.homegrownscripts"></a>Cloud-init vs. homegrown scripts</h5><p>David Nalley <a href="http://markmail.org/message/qs7k4akccoh7slk5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">raised a question from the Ghent Build-a-Cloud-Day</a> about "whether or not to package the SSH key reset and password reset utilities, or whether we should focus our PW/SSH efforts on cloud-init." </p><p>Wido den Hollander voiced support for cloud-init, saying "We want CloudStack to be accepted by more and more users and they probably want to use cloud-init. cloud-init has cool Puppet and Chef plugins as well which make it very <br>easy to get it all up and running."</p><p>Chiradeep Vittal says he likes cloud-init, but worried that adopting cloud-init would be "hurting the investment of existing CloudStack users who have built hundreds of templates with the extant scripts." </p><p>Wido says that "the scripts should keep working" but preferred to avoid packaging the homegrown scripts and encouraging new users/new setups to go with cloud-init.</p><p>Chip <a href="http://markmail.org/message/y5z3c7fnpotyzdmb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">says that</a> "I'm in agreement that the existing scripts would need to remain as a supported option for quite some time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another busy week in Apache CloudStack land! Javelin has been merged with master, the 4.1 branch has been created, and the 4.0.1-incubating release has passed its second round vote to go on to the IPMC vote.</p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4February2013-MajorDiscussionsandIssues"></a>Major Discussions and Issues</h3><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4February2013-JavelinMerged"></a>Javelin Merged</h5><p>The Javelin branch has been <a href="http://markmail.org/message/wl7it77lgrsllipu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">merged into master</a> by Kelven Yang. Kelven <a href="http://markmail.org/message/bpnxze6edj4bikvr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">has noted that developers should increase the amount of memory available to the JVM</a> if running the management server under Maven:</p><blockquote><p>For linux/Mac users</p><p>MAVEN_OPTS="-XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Xmx2g"<br>export MAVEN_OPTS</p><p>For Windows users</p><p>Add similar settings to windows environment settings (via Windows control panel)</p></blockquote><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4February2013-4.1BranchCreated"></a>4.1 Branch Created</h5><p>Following the Javelin merge, Chip Childers has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/6wpcd5kg2bvdpufy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">created the 4.1 branch</a>, and has asked committers "to respect the feature and improvement freeze in that branch. Bug fixes, doc updates and other release stabilization activities are obviously expected." Chip also says that committers should continue committing directly to the 4.1 branch until code freeze. (Code freeze, excepting fixes for blocker bugs and so forth, is on February 28th.) </p><p>If you're a non-committer and wish to send in a patch against 4.1.0, send in a patch built against the 4.1 branch. Chip says:</p><blockquote><p>Committers taking these fixes should also consider applying them to master.  If there are conflicts in master (which may happen, as there were a<br>couple of code-base refactoring activities, like switching packages from com.cloud to org.apache.cloudstack), apply the fix into 4.1 anyway, and inform the submitter that the patch has conflicts with master to get that sorted out (or you can fix it yourself).</p></blockquote><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4February2013-4.0.1incubatingVote"></a>4.0.1-incubating Vote</h5><p>The 4.0.1-incubating release has passed the <a href="http://markmail.org/message/zxvynd72xfansmho" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">vote</a> on cloudstack-dev, and is now in the 72-hour IPMC vote. Going into the vote on general@incubator.apache.org, the release artifacts already have 3 +1 mentor votes, so it should pass barring any -1 votes. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4February2013-PreparingforTranslation"></a>Preparing for Translation</h5><p>With the feature freeze in place, it's time to get docs into shape and start getting things ready for translations. Sebastien Goasguen <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/rq7pbo3tn4ur4lu5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">has created a new /pot directory</a> with the .pot (portable object templates). </p><p>Sebastien notes that contributors <a href="http://markmail.org/message/ykxnxp3r5bffzqrg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">need to remember the 50-character limit for XML filenames</a>, as Transifex doesn't support longer file names. Contributors will also need to run <b><em>publican update_pot</em></b> when updating doc files and/or creating new files.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4February2013-Packagingin4.1"></a>Packaging in 4.1</h5><p>Hugo Trippaers <a href="http://markmail.org/message/jlvpt3dgefcwacxl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">sent out an update</a> about the discussion on packaging for 4.1. Hugo says the main goal for redoing the current way of packaging CloudStack is to get "rid of ant and waf completely." The secondary goal "is to create a reference set of packages which in itself should be enough to get anyone going with CloudStack, but will hardly depend on the underlying distro. Real distro specific stuff should be handled by packagers from those distros. We just aim to provide a reference implementation."</p><p>Hugo also says that the plan is to rename the packages "to make it perfectly clear what somebody is installing." That's going to change the location of a number of files, but Hugo says "we intend to include symlinks for backwards compatibility." </p><blockquote><p>The planned packages for now are cloudstack-management, cloudstack-agent, cloudstack-common, cloudstack-cli, cloudstack-docs, cloudstack-awsapi and<br>cloudstack-usage. You might already have seen these names in some of the checkins.</p></blockquote><p>One of the side-effects of the new packaging plan is that <a href="http://markmail.org/message/47yguo5rfrszpie7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">CloudMonkey may not be installed with the RPMs</a>, but instead require that admins use PIP to grab CloudMonkey. </p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4February2013-SupportVMSnapshotHeldto4.2"></a>Support VM Snapshot Held to 4.2</h5><p>Mice Xia <a href="http://markmail.org/message/tctez5xpur2bzswe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">proposed merging the VM Snapshot branch</a> to master ahead of the 4.1 branching/feature freeze on January 28th. However, there were a <a href="http://markmail.org/message/bmwbjet5q7nlav6j" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">number of questions</a> <a href="http://markmail.org/message/nk525qhfdwqqil6n" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">about the feature's implementation</a> and <a href="http://markmail.org/message/yjaddguj67dqzbhe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">consensus was not reached</a> in time for the 4.1 branch's creation.</p><p>On the plus side, this is why we have time-based releases. While it will delay inclusion into CloudStack <b>slightly</b>, the feature will be well-poised to go into 4.2 and the additional attention that the discussion has raised will likely make it that much better a feature when merged to master. It also means that a single feature won't delay the 4.1 release, which already has quite a lot of improvements and new features that CloudStack users will want to have ready when it's scheduled for release.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4February2013-ProposaltoDeprecatethenonRESTfulAPIsandAPIServer"></a>Proposal to Deprecate the non-RESTful APIs and API Server</h5><p>Rohit Yadav has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/3nmgl5peuxeo4mvm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">proposed deprecating CloudStack's non-RESTful APIs and API server</a> over a reasonable timeline. The reaction has been positive, and Min Chen <a href="http://markmail.org/message/xnjf5ylpn55ddneb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">has offered to share an architecture design that's in-progress</a>, when it's ready.</p><h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4February2013-HelpReviewingRunbook"></a>Help Reviewing Runbook</h5><p>David Nalley has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/jint25r5gwgnx6ju" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">sent out a request</a> for help reviewing his runbook, which is an opinionated guide to setting up a simple CloudStack install on a single CentOS 6.3 server using KVM. Other CloudStack users and contributors have expressed interest in creating similar runbooks for Ubuntu-based systems.</p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4February2013-UpcomingEvents"></a>Upcoming Events</h3><ul><li><b>India User Group Meet-up</b>: Citrix, ShapeBlue, and CloudByte are&nbsp;combinedly&nbsp;organizing a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CloudStack-Bangalore-Group/events/99690432/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">CloudStack India User Group Meetup</a>&nbsp;in Bangalore (5 February, 2013).</li><li><b>Build a Cloud Day (BACD)</b>: Full day <a href="http://buildacloud.org/about-cloudstack/cloudstack-events/viewevent/138-build-a-cloud-day-scale11x-.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">BACD</a> at SCALE on Friday (22 February 2013).</li><li><b>CloudStack Booth at SCALE</b>: Meet with CloudStack folks at SCALE (23-24 February 2013), also Joe Brockmeier is <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x/presentations/taking-open-cloud-11-cloudstack" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">speaking about CloudStack at SCALE</a>.</li></ul><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4February2013-Jira"></a>Jira </h3><p>Be sure to check the list of 4.1.0 <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CLOUDSTACK%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%224.1.0%22%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">bugs</a> to see if there are any open issues assigned to you, or any unassigned issues that you could take on. </p><h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4February2013-NewCommittersandPPMCMembers"></a>New Committers and PPMC Members</h3><p>The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to welcome <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/p5b76rrp5h3j4k2u" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">Koushik Das</a> as a committer this week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the 4.0.0-incubating release of the CloudStack Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud orchestration platform. This is the first release from within the Apache Incubator, the entry path into the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).</p><p>Apache CloudStack is an integrated software platform that allows users to build a feature-rich IaaS. CloudStack includes an intuitive user interface and rich API for managing the compute, networking, accounting, and storage for private, hybrid, or public clouds. The project entered the Apache Incubator in April 2012.</p><p>The 4.0.0-incubating release represents the culmination of more than six months work by the CloudStack community. The release includes more than a dozen new features, many bugfixes, security fixes, and a fully audited codebase that complies with ASF guidelines. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="newfeatures:">New Features:<a href="#newfeatures:" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Features:" title="Direct link to New Features:">​</a></h2><ul><li>Inter-VLAN Routing (VPC)</li><li>Site-to-Site VPN</li><li>Local Storage Support for Data Volumes</li><li>Virtual Resource Tagging</li><li>Secure Console Access on XenServer</li><li>Added the ability to create a VM without immediately starting it (via API)</li><li>Upload an Existing Volume to a Virtual Machine</li><li>Dedicated High-Availability Hosts</li><li>Support for Amazon Web Services API (formerly a separate package)</li><li>AWS API Extensions to include Tagging</li><li>Support for Nicira NVP (L2)</li><li>Ceph RBD Support for KVM</li><li>Support for Caringo as Secondary Storage</li><li>KVM Hypervisor support upgraded to work with Ubuntu 12.04 and RHEL 6.3</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="downloads">Downloads<a href="#downloads" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Downloads" title="Direct link to Downloads">​</a></h2><p>The official source code release can be downloaded from:</p><p><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/cloudstack/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://incubator.apache.org/cloudstack/downloads.html</a></p><p>In addition to the official source code release, individual contributors have also made convenience binaries available on the Apache CloudStack download page.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cloudstackcollaborationconference">CloudStack Collaboration Conference<a href="#cloudstackcollaborationconference" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CloudStack Collaboration Conference" title="Direct link to CloudStack Collaboration Conference">​</a></h2><p>The CloudStack project will have its first collaboration conference in Las Vegas, from November 30th through December 2nd at The Venetian.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>]]></content:encoded>
