Each week, we'll summarize the most important issues and developments in the Apache CloudStack (incubating) community. This week, the vote on accepting Marvin tests, Apache CloudStack bylaws, issues with features for 4.1.0, and upcoming events.

<h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-14January2013-MajorDiscussionsandIssues"></a>Major Discussions and Issues</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Project Bylaws were <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/ma3g6hdgegu76g44" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">discussed previously</a> and after a substantial discussion on cloudstack-dev have <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/2q5b2y7oahgobqfg" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">passed</a>. The bylaws are intended to go into effect once Apache CloudStack graduates from the Apache Incubator. (Note that a vote on graduation is not currently pending.)</li>
	<li>Discussion about whether CloudStack should make a concerted effort to <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/moyctvlxmgrrorb5" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">get into Linux distros</a>.</li>
	<li>There are some <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/nu4f6tphsnsv7ls6" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">concerns about where development is happening</a> for major features being targeted for CloudStack 4.1.0. A number of features have been developed outside of the community, and may need to go through IP clearance to be accepted into master for 4.1.0.</li>
	<li>Discussion on how CloudMonkey should be released, whether it makes sense to <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/moyctvlxmgrrorb5" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">release CloudMonkey out-of-band via pypi or stick with major releases</a>.</li>
	<li>Reminder to developers to <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/pb3bmv44m6vwro4w" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">update status, risk, and issues in Jira items</a>.</li>
	<li>Vote to accept Marvin automated tests from Citrix <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/cqkim6v5nk73tur7" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">started on January 9th</a> the vote <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/vxwtwnhapmf7inw7" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">passed</a> and now will begin going through IP clearance.</li>
	<li><a href="http://markmail.org/thread/jhkqwujf23zegn5d" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Minutes from QA Scrum on 8 January 2013</a>.</li>
