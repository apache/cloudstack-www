<p>The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the immediate availability
of the Apache CloudStack CloudMonkey 5.0.0 release.</p>

<p>Apache CloudStack's CloudMonkey is a Python-based command line utility for
interacting with Apache CloudStack IaaS clouds.  The software provides
an interactive shell environment that includes command discovery,
auto-completion and multiple output formats. CloudMonkey can also be
used as a simple command line utility, which can be easily integrated
into larger shell scripts.</p>

<p>This is the first independently released version of CloudMonkey provided
by the Apache CloudStack project community.  This release includes
pre-cached API command syntax for Apache CloudStack versions up to
and including CloudStack 4.2.0.</p>

<p>The release can be obtained from the CloudMonkey section of the Apache
CloudStack download page:</p>
