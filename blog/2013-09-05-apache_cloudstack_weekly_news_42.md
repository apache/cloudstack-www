<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4September2013-HighQualityDocumentation"></a>High Quality Documentation</h5>

<p>For some time now there has been discussion around a possible replacement to our current use DocBook for our primary document editor. Sebastien Goasguen started a <a href="http://markmail.org/message/5z2umxi3whcyqddy" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">discussion</a> to look at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Markdown by Daring Fireball</a>. With there being concern about how to create and maintain high quality documentation, this is an important thread to participate in for anyone interested in the release documents. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>After seeing lots of frustrated people with folks I decided to try something out with markdown.</p>

<p>I used pandoc to convert some docbook files to markdown and I used a structure for a book based on 'The little mongodb' book.<br/>
We can generate epub and pdf using latex.</p>

<p>See: <a href="https://github.com/runseb/cloudstack-books" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">link</a></p>

<p>There are two "books" aimed at being step by step recipes. Not long, not convoluted, single OS, etcâ€¦simple step by step.</p>

<p>I am still sanitizing the installation one based on 4.2 .</p>

<p>Comments, flames ?</p></blockquote>
