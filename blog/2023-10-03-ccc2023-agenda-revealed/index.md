# A Glimpse into the Agenda

The [recently released agenda](https://www.cloudstackcollab.org/#schedule)
offers a tantalizing glimpse into what attendees can expect over the two days of
the conference. With a diverse range of sessions and workshops, there's a wealth
of knowledge to be gained and connections to be made. Here are some highlights
from the agenda:

**State of the Union, [Rohit Yadav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohityadavcloud/)**

Successful open source companies change their business models and then the open
source license they were distributing their software on. More and more it feels
like Open Source is just a marketing buzzword designed to lure customers to a
particular solution. On the regulatory front, the EU is implementing the CRA and
handling software as it were trucks manufacturing. Is there any hope left for
Open Source? Has it failed in delivering its premise?

Fear not. Open Source's not dead. It has already won and it will prevail again.
