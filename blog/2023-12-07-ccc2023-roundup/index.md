### Keynote Talk: Open Source is Not Dead, [Charles Schulz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesschulz/)

Successful Open Source companies change their business models and then the open
source license they were distributing their software on. More and more it feels
like Open Source is just a marketing buzzword designed to lure customers to a
particular solution. On the regulatory front, the EU is implementing the CRA and
handling software as it were trucks manufacturing. Is there any hope left for
Open Source? Has it failed in delivering its premise? Fear not. Open Source’s
not dead. It has already won and it will prevail again.

### Building a Software Makerspace with CloudStack to Drive Innovation by Improving Learning and Research Abilities at Universities, Jonas Willén, Pierre Le Fèvre, Emil Karlsson

A makerspace today is focused on turning ideas into physical prototypes by
providing resources in terms of tools and infrastructure. In a university, a
makerspace provides students with an opportunity to build a portfolio. Students
experiment through an entire development life cycle by creating prototypes for
each stage of a cycle. It has been shown to be a productive method for learning.

To the best of our knowledge, software development is yet to be included in the
makerspace concept. In the case of our software makerspace, it is following the
same principles as a traditional makerspace for device and mechanical
prototyping, but instead provides software development tools. One such
indispensable tool is cloud-based infrastructure. A cloud facilitates rapid
prototyping of machine learning tools, microservices, IoT data mining, etc. 

This talk presents their approach to extend the concept of a makerspace to
software development using a student developed private cloud. They present the
method they used to gather requirements from various researchers and students.
They also present the final design and the current implementation of the cloud
using Apache CloudStack. Finally, they discuss how other universities could
implement their own software makerspace and its benefits.

### DRBD Deep Dive, Philipp Reisner

LINSTOR/DRBD became a primary storage option for Apache CloudStack nearly two years ago. In this session, Philipp shares insights about the internals of DRBD, the data-path part of the data-storage solution.

Knowing about DRBD’s meta-data, the activity log, and the bitmap will enable you to make more educated decisions when it comes to selecting the right hardware for your next ApacheCloudStack+LINSTOR+DRBD deployment. When your servers have different storage tiers, what are the advantages and trade-offs regarding putting data and meta-data on different tiers?

Recently, DRBD got a new transport, load-balancing TCP, that joins the existing TCP transport, and the RDMA transport received important updates. Looking beyond DRBD, what is important to know when selecting the RAID level and data alignment? Philipp concludes the session with comments regarding LVM compared to ZFS.

### Enabling DPU Hardware Accelerators in XCP-ng Cloud Platform Environment, Andrei Semenov

In cloud computing environments, VMs require fast access to resources like
storage and networking. The hardware that the VMs access is implemented in
software and/or by passing through a dedicated hardware device. Software-based
solutions consume extra CPU cycles, thus resulting in poor performance. Also,
these require to expose a device-model to the guest, thus increasing the attack
surface. Conversely, hardware passthrough provides better performance and
security but can be expensive in terms of the number of physical resources,
since each device is dedicated to a single VM. This talk focuses on how Vates is
working on sharing hardware resources among VMs by relying on dedicated
processors named Data Processing Units (DPU). More precisely, Vates work on
offloading Xen hypervisor of storage emulation by relying on Kalray K200 DPU
PCIe controllers, a hardware accelerator based on MPPA architecture.
