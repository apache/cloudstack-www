The CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2025 took place in Milan,
Italy from November 19 to 21, bringing together CloudStack users,
developers, and operators from across the global community. This
annual in person event once again provided a valuable space for
collaboration, knowledge sharing, and shaping the future of Apache
CloudStack.

Hosted at the Enterprise Hotel in Milan, the conference featured a
packed agenda of technical sessions, deep dive workshops, and open
discussions. Topics ranged from CloudStack architecture and

world operational best practices. Attendees had the opportunity to
learn directly from industry experts, exchange experiences with peers,
and explore the latest developments across the CloudStack ecosystem.
