<strong>On 18-21<sup>st</sup> April, in Amsterdam, Netherlands will take place one of the largest flagship cloud conferences globally - </strong><a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/"><strong>KubeCon + Cloud NativeCon.</strong></a>

We are excited to share that Apache CloudStack will be a silver sponsor at the event, and that community members will be representing the technology and community on the global stage. Attendees will be able to come to the Apache CloudStack booth and learn more about the capabilities and use cases of CloudStack as a turnkey solution for cloud management. This will help further propel the awareness of Apache CloudStack, across an audience of leading cloud providers, MSPs and telcos.

Being part of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon is yet another level of progression for our community, as our representatives will be meeting a number of organisations in the Kubernetes ecosystem, introducing them to the technology for the first time, as well as showing recent and upcoming features to existing users. In particular, we will share the pitfalls, hacks, learnings, and key takeaways from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR8JXotMir8&t=44s">our journey to develop CAPC</a> - the CAPI Provider for Apache CloudStack.
