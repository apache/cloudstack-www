On 3-5th June, the [Apache Software
Foundation](https://www.apache.org) will be holding the annual
[Community Over Code EU](https://eu.communityovercode.org/)
conference. This year, attendees can anticipate engaging sessions led
by Apache CloudStack community members at the event. It serves as a
prime platform to stay aware of the newest developments within Apache
Software Foundation (ASF) projects and their associated
communities. Taking place in the charming city of Bratislava,
Slovakia, this event fosters an environment conducive to
collaborative, vendor-neutral discussions. Open-source communities
from across the globe will converge to freely exchange ideas and
strategize on various projects.
