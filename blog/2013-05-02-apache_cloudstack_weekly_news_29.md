 <p>This week, we had discussions about the release cycle and whether a six-month cycle may be more appropriate. Work continued on the 4.1.0 release, and Apache CloudStack 4.0.2 was released. </p>

<h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-MajorDiscussions"></a>Major Discussions</h3>

<p>Several major discussions this week, summarized below. Note that this is only a fraction of the activity in the project. For a full overview of project activity, you may want to subscribe to dev@cloudstack.apache.org. </p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-ReleaseCycle%3AFourMonths%2CorSix%3F"></a>Release Cycle: Four Months, or Six?</h5>

<p>Animesh Chaturvedi <a href="http://markmail.org/message/3ctdwor5hfbpa3vx" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">started new thread for a discussion that cropped up in the timeline thread</a> about the four-month vs. six-month release cycle ideas. After much discussion, <a href="http://markmail.org/message/rqqbtbumx6xnzrcr" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Animesh summed up the discussion</a> saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I still see there is difference of opinion and not a clear consensus with 12 out<br/>
of 21 ( approx. 60%) preferring 6 months.  But going by the argument of not<br/>
having given proper shot to 4 month cycle I will say we can keep 4.2 as a 4<br/>
month cycle and pull in all effort to make it successful.  If it turns out that<br/>
we can work with 4 month schedule that's well and good otherwise we can bring<br/>
this topic again based on the results of running 4 month cycle.</p></blockquote>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-4.1.0Approaches"></a>4.1.0 Approaches</h5>

<p>After clearing out a number of last-minute blockers, it looks like 4.1.0 may be just about ready to roll. Chip Childers <a href="http://markmail.org/message/fe44ea4vy4yughwm" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">posted on Friday</a> that he was waiting on confirmation on CLOUDSTACK-528 and CLOUDSTACK-2194 being fixed. If those are fixed, Chip says he will "proceed with starting the VOTE thread" Monday morning, Eastern time. </p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-ApacheCloudStack4.0.2Released"></a>Apache CloudStack 4.0.2 Released </h5>

<p>Joe Brockmeier <a href="http://markmail.org/message/vyukwk2nof5gaqko" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">announced the 4.0.2 release</a> on 24 April, along with security fixes for two security vulnerabilities. </p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-SecurityVulnerabilitiesinCloudStack4.0.x"></a>Security Vulnerabilities in CloudStack 4.0.x</h5>

<p>John Kinsella <a href="http://markmail.org/message/36mipmcuj7ryo7py" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">sent out an announcement detailing two security vulnerabilities</a> on 24 April:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Description:<br/>
The CloudStack PMC was notified of two issues found in Apache CloudStack:</p>

<p>1) An attacker with knowledge of CloudStack source code could gain<br/>
unauthorized access to the console of another tenant's VM.</p>

<p>2) Insecure hash values may lead to information disclosure. URLs<br/>
generated by Apache CloudStack to provide console access to virtual<br/>
machines contained a hash of a predictable sequence, the hash of<br/>
which was generated with a weak algorithm. While not easy to leverage,<br/>
this may allow a malicious user to gain unauthorized console access.</p>

<p>Mitigation:<br/>
Updating to Apache CloudStack versions 4.0.2 or higher will mitigate<br/>
these vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Credit:<br/>
These issues were identified by Wolfram Schlich and Mathijs Schmittmann<br/>
to the Citrix security team, who in turn notified the Apache<br/>
CloudStack PMC.</p></blockquote>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-ExposingAPIsthatcarryPOSTdata"></a>Exposing APIs that carry POST data</h5>

<p>Prasanna Santhanam <a href="http://markmail.org/message/ji4d23xozub3nehi" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">raised a discussion</a> about adding the ability to send user data as POST to commands. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm guessing we'll have to put in additional annotations on our APIs<br/>
that support POST so that API discovery can print the methods<br/>
supported (GET/POST). Right now it's only the deployVMCmd (AFAIK). But<br/>
I expect this will need to be done for others soon.</p>

<p>I've included POST support for <em>every</em> command in marvin but that's<br/>
just brute-force. To make it more intelligent I think we should apply<br/>
it to only apis that make sense as POST (causing side-effects). But<br/>
that needs to be exposed by the api endpoint.</p></blockquote>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-EnablingGitHubPullRequestNotification"></a>Enabling GitHub Pull Request Notification</h5>

<p>A discussion was brought up on dev@ this weekend about enabling notifications for pull requests made via GitHub. David Nalley <a href="http://markmail.org/message/f6cmckyakfa6sof4" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">remarked</a> that in his opinion, "there really isn't an option - if we are going to have a GitHub mirror, we also need to be able to deal with the pull requests there. Ignoring folks that submit pull requests is inappropriate."</p>

<p>Chip <a href="http://markmail.org/message/vwyio3i5merrwrv5" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">questioned the need for a GitHub mirror at all</a>. "Not sure the value, when you consider the confusion it causes WRT the canonical source repo."</p>

<p>Want to keep reading the CloudStack Weekly News? Many hands make light work, but having only one editor means getting the weekly news out every week is a "best effort" activity. A healthy community publication needs several contributors to ensure weekly issues go out on time.</p>

<p>If you have an event, discussion, or other item to contribute to the <em>Weekly News</em>, you can add it directly to the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/CloudStack+Weekly+News" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">wiki</a> by editing the issue you want your item to appear in. (The next week's issue is created before the current issue is published - so at any time there should be at least one issue ready to edit.) </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can send a note to the marketing@cloudstack.apache.org mailing list with a subject including <a href="" title="News">News</a>: <em>description of topic</em> or email the newsletter editor directly (jzb at apache.org), again with the subject <a href="" title="News">News</a>: <em>description of topic</em>. <b>Please include a link to the discussion in the mailing list archive or Web page with details of the event, etc.</b> </p>
