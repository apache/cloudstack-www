## Who Should Attend?

The CloudStack India User Group is for developers, cloud operators, engineers,
and technology leaders in India who are working with or curious about — Apache
CloudStack. Whether you’re deploying, managing, or building on CloudStack, this
event offers a platform to explore its capabilities, hear real-world
implementation stories, and engage with the open-source community driving the
project forward.

CSIUG brings together a diverse audience from across India’s growing cloud
ecosystem — including enterprises, cloud service providers, telecoms, and
managed service providers — all contributing to and benefiting from open-source
cloud infrastructure. You’ll also have the opportunity to connect directly with
core contributors, maintainers, and project committers in the region.

## Bonus - DC Tour!

"The CloudStack India User Group (CSIUG) meetup brings together real users and
developers to share practical insights, integrations, and success stories. With
tech talks, live demos, and face-to-face networking, it’s a great space for
anyone using or considering Apache CloudStack, to learn and connect with others.

If you're building or running IaaS cloud infrastructure in India, CSIUG is where
you want to be."
