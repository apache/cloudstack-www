Delivering cloud solutions need not be as complex and costly as some would have
thought. With the right technology stack, companies can quickly and easily
deploy a flexible and stable IaaS offering to support any business requirements,
as proIO discovered.

[proIO](https://www.proio.com/) was founded in Frankfurt, Germany, nearly 20 years ago, as Swen Brüseke
explains. “We wanted to create a company based on holistic IT concepts,
providing support and advice from system design and creation through to smooth
day-to-day running of operations.”, said Swen Brüseke, CEO of proIO.

The company started by remotely looking after its customer’s physical servers
and data centres in both Frankfurt and Hamburg - 24/7. This has grown to the
extent that they now support thousands of physical servers.

During the last few years, customer demand has led proIO to extend its support
services with a fully managed cloud offering to become a Managed Service
Provider specialising in open-source Linux applications.

<h2>А Move to CloudStack</h2>

The company migrated its cloud to CloudStack in 2019 for a number of reasons, as
Swen explained. “We had used it for several years on various other projects, and
so we had acquired a great amount of working knowledge. This experience
demonstrated to us how easy it was to set up a proof of concept and deploy a
CloudStack-based solution. It was also much easier to keep up to date once
deployed compared to other solutions we had looked at.

<h2>Fully Redundant Infrastructure Based on Open-Source Technologies</h2>

Currently, more than 95% of proIO’s virtual machines are Linux based. “Our
customers are not bothered whether their operating system is open source or
not,” explained Swen. “They just want their apps to run to support their
business. We now look after all types of customers from healthcare, hotel
booking, through automotive and clothing to publishing.

“It’s great the way that everybody helps each other out in the community,
contributing what they can to ensure CloudStack continues to develop and refine
as a product. I would recommend CloudStack wholeheartedly to any organisation
that is looking at developing a cloud-based infrastructure.”, says Swen Brüseke,
CEO of proIO.
