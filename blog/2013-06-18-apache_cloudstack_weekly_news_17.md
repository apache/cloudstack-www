This week we welcome another new committer, work continues on 4.1.1 and 4.2.0, and we have some interesting discussions on how we should release the CloudMonkey and Marvin tools used with CloudStack. We've also seen a few interesting marketing discussions, and the community is gearing up for the second <a href="http://cloudstackcollab.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">CloudStack Collaboration Conference</a> taking place 23 June through 25 June in Santa Clara, CA.</p>

<h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-17June2013-MajorDiscussions"></a>Major Discussions</h3>

<p>In this section we look at major discussions that have happened on the CloudStack mailing lists. This is by no means a full summary of all discussions on the lists, but we try to hit the highlights that are relevant to the larger CloudStack community. </p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-17June2013-Progresson4.1.1Release"></a>Progress on 4.1.1 Release</h5>

<p>With 4.1 now released we are already beginning work on the 4.1.1 patch update. Ilya Musayev is release manager for the 4.1.x branch, but Chip Childers <a href="http://markmail.org/message/6ionwrcqlh4pi2j4" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">will handle the 4.1.1 release</a> as Ilya is unavailable during the timeframe we expect to finish 4.1.1 and call for a VOTE.</p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-17June2013-CloudMonkeyandPyPIReleases"></a>CloudMonkey and PyPI Releases</h5>

<p>On June 9th, Rohit Yadav asked about a problem with the 4.1.0-0 CloudMonkey release on PyPI lacking the failsafe API cache:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I install it I don't get any api commands. The autodiscovery using sync is useful but only with the ApiDiscovery plugin which works only for 4.2 and later. For 4.1 and below I think we should, in that case, bundle the cache for all the apis. Or maybe<br/>
just oss components/plugins?</p></blockquote>

<p>David replied that "this is exactly why I've been <a href="http://markmail.org/message/wir5vfawex3y22ot" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">suggesting that we break CloudMonkey (and Marvin) out of the main repo</a>" and give them their own lifecycle. "It's far easier/faster to iterate cloudmonkey than all of CloudStack and tying it to the slower lifecycle of ACS will continue to trouble it IMO."</p>

<p>Rohit replied that "we should do it then." Prasanna Santhanam replied, "I haven't given breaking out the project much thought. But it's certainly a possibility." However, Prasanna <a href="http://markmail.org/message/vq3sqf7o3nckdy5p" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">notes that</a> "parts of the codebase" depend on Marvin, and it would require an "easier way to update Marvin across CloudStack providers to enable auto-updating Marvin's libraries like CloudMonkey can." </p>

<p>No final decisions have been made, but the discussion is still open for anyone that has a stake in how releases happen for Marvin and CloudMonkey.</p>

<p>Please let your voice and your organization be heard in this short survey. We would like to have both users of the Apache CloudStack source and Commercial derivatives, "We will be using the data in <b>aggregate</b> to get to know more about how it's being deployed out there." Chip Childers <a href="http://markmail.org/message/7s3ev7leok7uxucb?q" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">commented</a>.

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-17June2013-CloudStackCommunityVotestoPublishCloudStackBookList"></a>CloudStack Community Votes to Publish CloudStack Book List</h5>

<p>In a heavily <a href="http://markmail.org/message/jwoaknt7mdveklxp?q" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">discussed</a> topic throughout the community to allow the publishing of outside books about CloudStack on the CloudStack.Apache.Org website or wiki, it was finally voted on and decided to allow outside publications to be published. Right now Sebastien Goasguen has setup a <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/CloudStack+Books" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">wiki page</a> and will work on where to have the permanent placement for this page. Sebastien posted the full results <a href="http://markmail.org/message/wnfcn2gcxs3p7do3" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">on June 12</a>, but noted that there's a question about voting on a list that isn't dev@:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...<br/>
Our bylaws (1) do not cover votes on non-technical matters, so while we have<br/>
lazy majority on this vote it seems that this situation is not covered by the<br/>
bylaws. Moreover section 3.1.1 of bylaws says that decisions on the project<br/>
happen on dev@, so it seems that votes even on marketing@ are not allowed<br/>
(unsure about this).</p>

<p>I propose the following:</p>

<p>1-To move forward without having to re-cast a vote, I propose to list<br/>
immediately the books on the Wiki, and inform Packt. I just created the page (2)<br/>
2- If people agree that we have a bylaw "loophole", we need to modify the bylaws<br/>
to allow votes on marketing@ and agree on using Lazy majority or Lazy 2/3<br/>
majority. </p>

<p>Once we agree, I will inform users@ and dev@ and invite folks who participated<br/>
in this vote to join marketing@</p>

<p>3- We could then re-cast a vote to list on the website</p>
