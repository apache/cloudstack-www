<h2>Why Choose Apache CloudStack If You Are A Cloud Builder</h2>

A problem that many businesses face when entering the public cloud market is
finding the suitable software and partners which enable a rapid deployment for
their customers. Often, it takes up a significant number of resources and can
have a negative financial impact on the company if the wrong decision is made.

CloudStack is a turnkey solution for cloud builders and manages service
providers. It is completely open-source, easy to implement, manage and scale.
Powered by a large open-source community and following rapid release cycles,

servers installed in geographically distributed data centers.
