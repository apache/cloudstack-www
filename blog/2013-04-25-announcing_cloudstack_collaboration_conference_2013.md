This time we&#8217;re gathering the community in Santa Clara, California from Sunday June 23rd through Tuesday June 25th.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on in the Apache CloudStack community, and you won&#8217;t want to miss the opportunity to catch up with the developers that are moving CloudStack forward, users who have successfully built production clouds, and integrators who are helping build a healthy ecosystem around the open foundation of Apache CloudStack. The conference is your opportunity to exchange ideas, discuss plans for Apache CloudStack, learn how others are using it, and to participate in workshops and sprints about CloudStack. </p>

<p>We will, of course, be having some quality fun time help the community get to know one another and offset all the hard work we&#8217;ve been doing to move the Apache CloudStack project to a top-level project and get the 4.1.0 release close to shipping. </p>
