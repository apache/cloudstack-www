Some respectable progress in knocking out major and blocker bugs for 4.1.0 as well. The project also welcomes two new PPMC members and three new committers.</p>

<h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4March2013-MajorDiscussions"></a>Major Discussions</h3>

<p>Some of the major discussions and issues that have taken place on cloudstack-dev and cloudstack-users in the past week. This is by no means exhaustive, if you need to be up-to-date on all development issues in the project, you'll definitely want to be subscribed to the mailing lists&#33;</p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4March2013-SummaryofWhyWhereandHowDevelopmentHappensMatters"></a>Summary of Why Where and How Development Happens Matters</h5>

<p>Chip Childers kicked off a thread about <a href="http://markmail.org/message/ydbkugl5sqpnz6m5" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">why it matters where and how development happens</a>, based on a discussion that had taken place on cloudstack-private:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's largely a re-hash of things that have already been discussed, but we wanted to get this summary moved into the dev list so that the points are available for reference. We should probably distill this into a wiki page somewhere, but that's not done quite yet (volunteer?).  Keep in mind<br/>
that I've tried to pull the important parts of the conversation into this email...  it was a fairly long thread of discussion and debate.<br/>
I'd suggest reading it all the way to the end to form your own understanding of why we have to be careful about how we work as a community.</p>

<p>The TL;DR version:</p>

<p>The issue that we ran into with several features being developed "outside the community" for 4.1 was a major deal, and it had several<br/>
implications.  First, doing that effectively hurts our community.  The other issue is related to the legal right of the project to accept the<br/>
code developed elsewhere.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rather than summarizing it here, I'd recommend that readers spend the time to read Chip's initial email and the replies in the thread.</p>

<p>Rohit Yadav <a href="http://markmail.org/message/josnaa7tgvnmruva" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">shared "that the do-it-yourself systemvm appliance feature works for me, for Xen,"</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is one catch though, VirtualBox exports VHD appliance which is said to be compliant with HyperV. I thought we may need to do something for Xen separately, so I followed and <a href="http://rohityadav.in/logs/building-systemvms/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">found a way</a>. The "way" is to export a raw disk image and convert it to a VHD <a href="/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CLOUDSTACK&amp;title=1&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=30755264" class="createlink">1</a> but the problem is the VHD created from that "way" fails when vhd-util tries to scan for any dependent VHDs (parents etc.), I don't know what's the reason.</p></blockquote>

<p>Read the rest of the thread if you have an interest in creating custom system VMs for CloudStack.</p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4March2013-FixingtheTomcatSituation%2CPost4.1"></a>Fixing the Tomcat Situation, Post 4.1</h5>

<p>Noa Resare has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/l63bhfmzbdmh37oa" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">admitted being intensely frustrate</a> with "the current tomcat situation" when working on packaging CloudStack. The current setup, says Noa, has many problems. In response, Noa has started a proof-of-concept "of a replacement for this whole mess yesterday, a few tens of lines of code setting up an embedded jetty web container. A few lines of code to parse a config file, set up logging and spawn an embedded servlet container."</p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4March2013-ChangingProjectBylawstoModifyPMCChairVotingProcessandTerm"></a>Changing Project Bylaws to Modify PMC Chair Voting Process and Term</h5>

<p>Chip kicked off a VOTE thread last week <a href="http://markmail.org/message/w6fn62vqsphyqd6q" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">to modify the project bylaws slightly</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As <a href="http://markmail.org/message/ifwwce657u36yuwz" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">previously discussed</a>, we'd like to make a <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Apache+CloudStack+Project+Bylaws" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">change to our bylaws</a> to modify the method of selecting a PMC chair.  We also want to add a term for the chair.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://markmail.org/message/sgqllgaogduwybhr" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">text was clarified slightly</a> during the vote. The vote remains open until March 5.</p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4March2013-SupportLifetime"></a>Support Lifetime</h5>

<p>With the 4.1 release getting closer, David Nalley <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/a327j3vqw6pklhho" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">raised the topic of the support lifetime for releases</a>. Chip <a href="http://markmail.org/message/xvvudgauegit3j4t" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">proposed a model</a> that would consist of only bug fix releases for:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>The latest feature release of our active major version number (i.e.: 4.x)</li>
	<li>The latest feature release of our last major version number (doesn't exist today, but will be 4.x when / if we bump to 5.0)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Joe Brockmeier replied with a &#43;1, saying that with the current level of participation in the bug-fix releases "this is the most realistic approach that's good for the community."</p>

<p>David asked whether an end of support means an end to bug fixes and security fixes at the same time. "Wearing your enterprise software consumer hat - does a supportlifetime of approximately 12 months make sense?" Instead, David proposed "we should add a month (so that EOL is one month after 4.n+2 releases, with the understanding that 4.n is likely to only receive security fixes if any during that extra one month window.)"</p>

<p>The discussion continues, so developers and users that have a vested interest in the support lifetime for ACS releases would do well to follow and respond to the discussion.</p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4March2013-APIThrottling"></a>API Throttling</h5>

<p>Parth Jagirdar has <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/nj75xlemzxcy5qr2" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">started a discuss thread</a> about API throttling. "API throttling number can be set to anything at this point. Suggestions here is to have this number set to a value that is 'greater than' number of API that can be fired by any potential action on UI." (Note, Parth then sent out a follow-up email to correct the initial subject line from [DISCUSS} to <a href="/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CLOUDSTACK&amp;title=DISCUSS&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=30755264" class="createlink">DISCUSS</a>, but all relevant discussion has happened in the original thread. It's probably not necessary to send a follow-up in those situations and may fragment the conversation.)</p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4March2013-BranchStabilityStatus"></a>Branch Stability Status</h5>

<p>Sudha Ponnaganti posted a report to the &#45;dev mailing list about <a href="http://markmail.org/message/tpxixcsatkduodq4" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">branch stability for QA testing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4.1 Branch:<br/>
&#42;Xen and VMWare are blocked with the following two issues. KVM is working fine (agent issue-1469 has been fixed by Hugo).<br/>

<h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4March2013-Jira"></a>Jira</h3>

<p>Big bug-fixing week for Apache CloudStack&#33; The community knocked out 5 blocker bugs, 3 critical bugs, 9 major bugs, and 3 minor bugs. Still plenty of work left to do before 4.1.0 is ready for prime-time, though.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Last week: 9 blocker bugs. This week: 4 <a href="http://is.gd/blockers41acs" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">blocker bugs</a></li>
	<li>Last week: 21 critical bugs. This week: 18 <a href="http://is.gd/critical41acs" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">critical bugs</a></li>
	<li>Last week: 200 major bugs. This week: 191 <a href="http://is.gd/major41acs" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">major bugs</a></li>
	<li>Last week: 33 minor bugs. This week: 30 <a href="http://is.gd/minor41acs" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">minor bugs</a></li>
</ul>


<p>It's worth noting that the doc sprint helped quite a bit, bringing the total number of docs bugs for 4.1.0 to 44 (down from 64 just two weeks ago). Of the remaining bugs for 4.1.0, 80 are <a href="http://is.gd/unassigned41acs" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">currently unassigned</a>, down from 99 last week.</p>
