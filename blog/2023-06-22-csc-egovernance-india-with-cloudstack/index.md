# CSC e-Governance India with CloudStack

In order to access these services, [CSC E-Governance India](https://csc.gov.in/)
chose CloudStack to underpin the delivery and build a government community cloud
for powering applications which aid in creating a digitally inclusive ecosystem.
In 2022, the system caters to an average of more than 200 million citizens every

Since 2015, there were approximately 100,000 kiosks and 28 million
