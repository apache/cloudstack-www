<h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-10June2013-MajorDiscussions"></a>Major Discussions</h3>

<p>In this section we look at major discussions that have happened on the CloudStack mailing lists. This is by no means a full summary of all discussions on the lists, but we try to hit the highlights that are relevant to the larger CloudStack community. </p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-10June2013-4.1Releases"></a>4.1 Releases</h5>

<p>The first major release of Apache CloudStack since it became a top level project was released on June 5, 2013 and is available. For more information, please see the official <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/apache_cloudstack_4_1_0" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">announcement.</a> </p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-10June2013-4.2FeatureFreezePushBack"></a>4.2 Feature Freeze Push Back</h5>

<p>Due to the delays in releasing 4.1 release, it was requested by many in the community to push back the freeze date. Chip Childers called for a Vote on 5/31 to move the Feature Freeze back from 5/31 to 6/28 (<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Cloudstack+4.2+Release" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Updated Schedule</a>). The push back was approved with 19 +1 votes (<a href="http://markmail.org/message/2pd33ofdegqugsi2?q" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">full results</a>).</p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-10June2013-CloudStackCommunitySurveyUnderway"></a>CloudStack Community Survey Underway</h5>

<p>Please let your voice and your organization be heard in this short survey. We would like to have both users of the Apache CloudStack source and Commercial derivatives, "We will be using the data in <b>aggregate</b> to get to know more about how it's being deployed out there." Chip Childers <a href="http://markmail.org/message/7s3ev7leok7uxucb?q" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">commented</a>.

	<li><b><a href="http://buildacloud.org/blog/259-cloudstack-university.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">CloudStack University</a></b> by Sebastien Goasguen: <em>At Apache CloudStack we recently started an initiative to organize our content into learning modules. We call this initiative CloudStack University. Everyone is invited to participate by contributing content (slides and screencasts), suggesting new learning modules that are needed and even creating exercises and assignments. School fun ! As we were discussing the initiative on the mailing list we started by looking at our existing content: slideshares, youtube videos and thought about organizing them into a CloudStack 101 course. This is still a work in progress that requires everyones participation to make it a great resource.</em></li>
