<p>The CloudStack Collaboration Conference schedule is now up! You can find it at:</p>

<p>A big thank you to everyone who's submitted talks, and to David Nalley, Chip Childers, and John Kinsella for helping wade through the submissions. We were initially concerned about the quantity of submissions given the short run-up to the conference - but we were blown away by the quality *and* quantity of the submissions.</p>

<p>We'll be announcing keynotes shortly, and the evening events. A lot of really good stuff coming for the conference - I hope to see many of you there, you really don't want to miss it!</p>
