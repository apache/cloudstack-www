"At NTT/Itelligence we were eagerly anticipating this latest version of Apache CloudStack as many of the features in the release are of importance to our Itelligence cloud solution," said Andre Walter, VP, Head of GMS Cloud Infrastructure Services at Itelligence Global Managed Services GmbH. "We are particularly excited about the vSphere advanced capabilities and full OVF properties support. It is important for us to see the Open Source community bringing more and more features that allow us to enhance our global cloud operations capabilities."

"Apache CloudStack continues to bring innovative features for public cloud providers like us,"  said Wido den Hollander, CTO of PCExtreme. "With the 4.15 release, we are very interested in the Redfish implementation for Out of Band Management which helps bring the next generation of server management to our data centres. The fact that the CloudStack community is driven by users of the software as opposed to vendors with competing interests means that time and time again we see these exciting features delivered In Apache CloudStack."

"Apache CloudStack continues to cement itself as the logical choice for reliable, open source IaaS orchestration," said Giles Sirett, CEO of ShapeBlue. "It is proven, hugely scalable and, most importantly, easy to deploy and operate.
