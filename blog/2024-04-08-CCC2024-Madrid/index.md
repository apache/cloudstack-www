## Exclusive In-Person Experience in 2024

This year's conference is breaking new ground by going exclusively
in-person. After careful consideration, collecting feedback from the
community and planning, this year we will offer to the community the
opportunity to meet face-to-face, fostering deeper connections and
more meaningful interactions than ever before.

We did our best to deliver the CloudStack Community to everybody
interested during the pandemic time for a few years. Now, we are
focusing on growing the community and giving a chance to all
contributors, committers and people interested into the project, to
meet in-person and interact in a better way.

## Hackathon Day - November 20th

Kickstarting the event on November 20th is a hackathon. Developers,
engineers, and project committers will come together to unleash their
creativity, tackle real-world challenges, and push the boundaries of
what's possible within the CloudStack ecosystem.

## Technical Sessions and Panels - November 21st and 22nd

The excitement continues over the following two days with a jam-packed
schedule of technical sessions, thought-provoking talks, and engaging
panel discussions. Dive deep into the latest advancements, exchange
best practices, and explore emerging trends shaping the world of cloud
infrastructure and beyond.
