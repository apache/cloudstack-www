<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18March2013-CloudStackGettingClosertoGraduation"></a>CloudStack Getting Closer to Graduation</h5>

<p>Chip Childers notified the project that <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/zhymhs35ic3rruq5" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">the graduation resolution has passed the IPMC vote</a>. With the votes passed, it's now up to the Apache Software Foundation board to discuss. The next board meeting is on March 20th, though it's unclear whether the IPMC vote was finalized in time for the matter to be discussed during this meeting.</p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18March2013-EclipseandMavenWorkingTogether"></a>Eclipse and Maven Working Together</h5>

<p>Alex Huang wrote last week that <a href="http://markmail.org/message/f265rx7r5qm7z6yz" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">he's made some changes</a> to "help developers with better productivity." To put it succinctly, Alex found that there are better ways to build CloudStack using Eclipse and Maven together, and has written a script to help developers speed up their tools. The procedure and new <em>impatient</em> profile should be documented on the wiki soon.</p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18March2013-PaloAlto"></a>Palo Alto</h5>

<p>Will Stevens <a href="http://markmail.org/message/n5276i4hfh7ek57o" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">brought up a topic about integrating the Palo Alto firewall</a> with CloudStack:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem I am running into right now is that Palo Alto does not allow any two interfaced to have the same IP (even if they are in different zones, vrs, vsys and vlans). This is an issue because CloudStack supports each account having their own private IP ranges and two accounts can use the same private IP range. For example, by default if you create a network with source nat and you do not specify any gateway or subnet data, it will give you 10.1.1.0/24 as an IP range. This means it will be very likely that two CloudStack accounts will be using the same private IP space.</p></blockquote>

<p>Alex <a href="http://markmail.org/message/iyydkgxzvbzmo4jw" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">replied</a>, "There is a mode in CloudStack that only allows non-intersecting cidrs for guest networks. It was introduced specifically because many physical network devices do not expect cidrs to intersect even when it's on different VLANs."</p>

<p>Stuck on a technical issue? Ask on the &#45;dev list, and it's quite likely you'll not only get an answer &#8211; odds are someone's had the problem you've got before, and thought about a solution.</p>
