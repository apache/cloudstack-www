# A Quest for the Perfect Fit

weSystems embarked on a journey to find the ideal platform for building a
multi-tenant IaaS cloud offering that could handle diverse workloads and support
managed hosting and application services. The chosen platform needed to
encompass several key features, including support for multiple zones,
multi-tenancy, integration with the Kubernetes ecosystem, Ceph Storage, and the
flexibility to create custom service offerings. After evaluating multiple
options, CloudStack emerged as the frontrunner, surpassing alternatives like
OpenStack, Proxmox, and VMware.

# Empowering Complex Solutions

The implementation journey began with a Proof of Concept (PoC) to evaluate
CloudStack's capabilities. It quickly became evident that CloudStack offered the
clarity of documentation, ease of setup, and daily operation that weSystems was
seeking. Once the PoC was established, they moved on to set up a productive zone
and simultaneously focused on developing automation processes, tooling, usage
tracking, and billing.

Through rigorous testing and adaptation, the team found that CloudStack's
versatility allowed them to address unexpected challenges effectively. The
platform seamlessly integrated into their technology stack components, promoting
operational efficiency and team trust. The ability to deploy standard and
customized virtual machines, along with a clean and intuitive Web UI and API,
facilitated easy adoption among the team and customers.

# Contributing to the Open-Source Community

As advocates of open-source software, weSystems finds value in contributing to
CloudStack's ecosystem. They actively participate by proposing new
functionalities, contributing code to the open and transparent codebase, and
offering support to the community. The extensive and passionate community
surrounding CloudStack provides a safety net for operational concerns and
troubleshooting.
