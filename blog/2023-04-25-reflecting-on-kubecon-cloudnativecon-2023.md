For the first year, the Apache CloudStack Community has participated at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon- the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/?_gl=1*x7ihno*_ga*MjA1MDg5MzgzMS4xNjc5OTAwNzUy*_ga_VWZ4V8CGRF*MTY4MjQwNDA5NC4xMS4wLjE2ODI0MDQwOTQuMC4wLjA.)’s flagship conference,
which gathers adopters and technologists from leading open source and cloud
native communities. It has been a fantastic opportunity for us to represent our
technology on the global stage, and meet engineers, DevOps and infrastructure
experts. Community members have had the pleasure of running attendees through
multiple CloudStack demos and answering their many questions about the
open-source cloud management solution. We also had the opportunity to share the
pitfalls, hacks, learnings, and key takeaways from
[our journey to develop CAPC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR8JXotMir8&t=44s) –
the CAPI Provider for Apache CloudStack.

<h3>The CloudStack Booth</h3>

Community members representing and sharing knowledge of Apache CloudStack with
the broader cloud industry had a thoroughly enjoyable time at the conference. We
manage to engage with global cloud providers, telecoms, consulting companies,
gaming companies and service providers.

We discussed a lot with attendees on topics like building hybrid clouds, keeping
infrastructure costs under control, decreasing cloud complexity, and ensuring
the best infrastructure for running containers at scale while maintaining
investments in infrastructure low.

<h3>Explore the Kubernetes Cluster API Provider for Apache CloudStack</h3>

The Kubernetes Cluster API (CAPI) provider for Apache CloudStack allows
Kubernetes users to build and manage resources on Apache CloudStack. The
provider is available under the Apache 2 open-source license and is managed by
the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). The Cluster API brings
declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and
management. The API itself is shared across multiple cloud providers allowing
for true Apache CloudStack hybrid deployments of Kubernetes. It is built atop
the lessons learned from previous cluster managers such as kops and kubicorn.

<h3>Discover the Upcoming CloudStack Events</h3>

**CloudStack European User Group**: The next event that the Apache CloudStack
community is hosting is the CloudStack European User Group, taking place on **4th
May** in the Gandhi Room at Cifas, Tavistock Square, 7-12 Lynton House, **London**,
WC1H 9LT. This event is an annual 1-day technical event for the European
CloudStack community.

**CloudStack Collaboration Conference**: Taking place on **23-24th November**,
with the location to be announced in the new future, CCC is the most significant global
CloudStack and open-source cloud builders event. The two-day hybrid event is
aimed at developers, operators and users to discuss and evolve the open-source
software project, its functionality and real-world operability. This event will
introduce you to the CloudStack family, community leaders, project members and
contributors. Registration details will be announced **in the near future**, so make
sure to keep an eye out on the [CloudStack mailing lists](/mailing-lists) of
[CloudStack’s social media channels](https://twitter.com/CloudStack).

<h3>Why Choose Apache CloudStack</h3>

Apache CloudStack helps cloud builders solve their key challenges – costs,
vendor lock-in and using fewer resources to manage tens of thousands of physical
servers installed in geographically distributed data centers. The turnkey
solution, made for cloud builders and managed service providers, is open-source
and easy to implement, manage and scale - particularly when compared to
alternative cloud orchestration platforms.
