It consists of two well-concerted components. LINSTOR and DRBD. Each of them also has its independent use cases, where it is deployed alone. In this presentation, the combination of these two is examined. They form the control plane and the data plane of the SDS. We will touch on: Performance, scalability, hyper-convergence (data-locality for high IO performance), resiliency through data replication (synchronous within a site, 2-way, 3-way, or more), snapshots, backup (to S3), encryption at rest, deduplication, compression, placement policies (regarding failure domains), management CLI and webGUI, monitoring interface, self-healing (restoring redundancy after device/node failure), the federation of multiple sites (async mirroring and repeatedly snapshot difference shipping), QoS control (noisy neighbors limitation) and of course: complete integration with CloudStack for KVM guests. It is Open Source software following the Unix philosophy. Each component solves one task, made for maximal re-usability. The solution leverages the Linux kernel, LVM and/or ZFS, and many Open Source software libraries. Building on these giant Open Source foundations, not only saves LINBIT from re-inventing the wheels, it also empowers your day 2 operation teams since they are already familiar with these technologies.</div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEWjocVhzno&amp;list=PLnIKk7GjgFlYcKNbhYSgWGbJ8nJ0g496V&amp;index=22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/3a720046-c093-4636-83bb-e48f4f64da92" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 11.41.03.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/a81uXODtt3KItT" width="854" height="712" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> </iframe><div><strong>About Phillip Reisner:</strong></div><div>Philipp Reisner is one of the founders and CEO of LINBIT in Vienna/Austria.

With the help of Stack Console’s reseller management module and CloudStack, a data center or cloud service provider can build resellers/partners and provide them with an automated white-label cloud management platform so they can sell cloud services under their own brand, such as compute, Kubernetes, load balancer, block storage, and so on. Many of resellers are likely to be small and medium-sized businesses that want to get into the cloud market, so this is great news for them. Service providers will still make money whether a customer buys a service directly from them or through one of their resellers.</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_nhzY3-QZs&amp;list=PLnIKk7GjgFlYcKNbhYSgWGbJ8nJ0g496V&amp;index=24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/6b18b8d7-3faf-4f2d-87cc-2ea5686f305e" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 11.46.25.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/hLfHYS9nzHSnt9" width="854" height="712" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> </iframe><div><strong>About Saurabh Rapatwar:</strong></div><div>Saurabh is a leader, an innovator, and a technology pioneer with more than 13 years of experience in the SaaS, IaaS, and technology domains.

I am currently working on the following project: CloudStack Terraform Provider – Add datasources for the existing resources <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/ZVraist1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/ZVraist1</a> I would like to present a tutorial/workshop as a knowledge transfer session. As CloudStack continues to grow in terms of resources, an explanation of how to extend Terraform provider will be beneficial to anyone who is interested in this area. In addition, I will share technical details regarding the provider during the presentation.</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdA2epTfu7k&amp;list=PLnIKk7GjgFlYcKNbhYSgWGbJ8nJ0g496V&amp;index=37" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/0342b432-2672-49e4-bbd7-7578536d720a" alt="Daman.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/f8FIToyKAkVfCD" width="854" height="712" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> </iframe><div><strong>About Daman Arora:</strong></div><div>Daman Arora is a GSoC 2022 student, as well as an Apache CloudStack Contributor.</div><div></div><div><span><strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ShapeBlue/productize-invoice-cloudstack-usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Productize &amp; Invoice CloudStack Usage">Productize &amp; Invoice CloudStack Usage</a> - Will Stevens, Daniel Murray</strong></span></div><div>CloudMC is an edge orchestration platform which allows for the productization of backend services, such as Apache CloudStack.
