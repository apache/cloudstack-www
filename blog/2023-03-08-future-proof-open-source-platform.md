Your.Online needed to build a centralized IaaS cloud platform for four of their
brands - Versio, Yourhosting, Savvii and Axarnet. The four companies ran on
different infrastructure platforms using technologies like VMware, RHEV, Xen
server, Virtuozzo, Proxmox, custom-built solutions and many others. This made it
extremely hard and nearly impossible to manage their infrastructure centrally
and ensure reliability and operational effectiveness.

<h2>Building a Centralised Platform Based on CloudStack</h2>

Your.Online has built a centralized platform powered by CloudStack, Ceph,
TrueNAS and KVM to be utilized by all their hosting brands. The new solution
allowed the company to simplify infrastructure management and have end-to-end
visibility of the processes inside from a single pane of glass.

Your.Online uses BGP, EVPN and VXLAN with CloudStack’s Advanced networking
model. This allows them to scale networks very easily in a redundant and
high-performant way over multiple data centers. This is a built-in functionality
of CloudStack, which when combined with IPv6 support and security groups makes
for a modern and future-proof solution, on which they can continue to invest and
grow.

<h2>Ensuring Reliability in the Long Term</h2>

“One of the reasons to centralize on CloudStack is to have one single point of
truth about the utilization of our assets. One overview of the VMs, assets and
capacity utilization. Now we can automate against one platform, and for us, the
main driver to choosing CloudStack was that it is an open-source project
governed by the Apache Software Foundation. We know it is a stable platform both
from a technical and legal perspective. The project will be live in the next ten
years, allowing us to avoid the risk associated with commercial projects -
usually licensing and governance problems.”

<h2>About Apache CloudStack</h2>

Apache CloudStack is an open-source cloud management solution designed to deploy
and manage large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly
scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. CloudStack
is used by a number of service providers to offer public cloud services, and by
many companies to provide an on-premises (private) cloud offering, or as part of
a hybrid cloud solution.
