slug: apache_cloudstack_4_0_11
---
<p>The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the 4.0.1-incubating release of the CloudStack Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud orchestration platform. This is a minor release in the 4.0.0 branch, which contains fixes for more than 30 bugs.</p>

<p>Apache CloudStack is an integrated software platform that allows users to build a feature-rich IaaS. CloudStack includes an intuitive user interface and rich API for managing the compute, networking, accounting, and storage for private, hybrid, or public clouds. The project entered the Apache Incubator in April 2012.</p>

<p>The 4.0.1-incubating release includes fixes for a number of issues, including a minor security vulnerability (CVE-2012-5616), problems adding KVM hosts, fixes to documentation, and more. Please see the <a href="http://is.gd/acs401CHANGES">CHANGES</a> file in the release for a full list of issues that are fixed in this release. As a bugfix release, no new features are included in 4.0.1-incubating, and it should be a simple upgrade from 4.0.0-incubating.</p>

<h2>Downloads</h2>

<p>The official source code release can be downloaded from:</p>

<p><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/cloudstack/downloads.html">http://incubator.apache.org/cloudstack/downloads.html</a></p>

<p>In addition to the official source code release, individual contributors have also made convenience binaries available on the Apache CloudStack download page.</p>

<h2>Incubating</h2>

<p>Apache CloudStack is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>
