<em>“The 4.19 release marks a significant milestone for CloudStack, combining a
diverse array of new features and crucial fixes. The primary focus has been on
enhancing the ease of adopting CloudStack, evident in capabilities like VMware
to KVM migration and KVM ingestion. The introduction of the Object Store
framework introduces a new dimension to storage capabilities within CloudStack.
Features such as hypervisor-agnostic DRS and Snapshot Copy DRaaS further bolster
the orchestration capabilities of CloudStack. 

The release process has been a year-long collaborative effort involving over 40
contributors from both organizations and individuals. Kudos to the community
members who not only contributed fantastic features but also played a crucial
role in testing and refining each other's work. This collaborative endeavour
has culminated in a feature-rich and stable 4.19 release.”</em>
