We’re pleased to announce that the CloudStack European User Group
(CSEUG) 2026 will take place in the Netherlands on May 21st. This year’s
event will be hosted by CBS (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek) in
the Hague. The one-day technical event is open to cloud builders,
infrastructure managers, and anyone interested in open-source cloud
and IaaS technology.

As the first official CloudStack event of 2026, it is a great
opportunity to start the year by learning, sharing ideas, meeting
other operators and contributors, and exploring the latest
developments across CloudStack and the wider open-source cloud
ecosystem.

## Who the CloudStack European User Group is For

Whether you are designing a new platform, migrating away from proprietary infrastructure, improving operational reliability, or planning for long term scalability, this event is for you. Typically the CSEUG is visited by:

- Cloud architects building modern private and hybrid clouds
- Developers extending CloudStack or integrating cloud automation
- Operators running CloudStack at scale and managing real world workloads
- IT leaders looking for flexible, cost-effective cloud infrastructure
- Open-source enthusiasts exploring the best alternatives to vendor lock in
- Organisations building sovereign clouds and many more

The agenda will bring together practical technical content, real world
experiences, and open discussion, with the goal of helping attendees
learn from each other and leave with ideas they can apply into their
own infrastructure.

## Call for Presentations is Open

The Call for Presentations is officially open, and we’re inviting the community to submit session proposals.
