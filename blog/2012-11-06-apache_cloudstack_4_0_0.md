<p>The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the 4.0.0-incubating release of the CloudStack Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud orchestration platform. This is the first release from within the Apache Incubator, the entry path into the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).</p>

<p>Apache CloudStack is an integrated software platform that allows users to build a feature-rich IaaS. CloudStack includes an intuitive user interface and rich API for managing the compute, networking, accounting, and storage for private, hybrid, or public clouds. The project entered the Apache Incubator in April 2012.</p>

<p>The 4.0.0-incubating release represents the culmination of more than six months work by the CloudStack community. The release includes more than a dozen new features, many bugfixes, security fixes, and a fully audited codebase that complies with ASF guidelines. </p>

<h2 id="incubating">Incubating</h2>

<p>Apache CloudStack is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>
