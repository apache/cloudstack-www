# A Note from Our VP

![](vp.png "VP Apache CloudStack")
>“CloudStack meetups allow our community of users, contributors, vendors and
>integrators to get together, collaborate and network to share their problems,
>discuss ideas and solutions around CloudStack.
>
>Meetups give the opportunity for attendees to hear from speakers on real-world
>use of CloudStack, learn about their solutions, integrations and about upcoming
>features and releases of CloudStack. It's just a great place to be for anybody
>considering CloudStack or starting to build private cloud.”
