Don't worry, no foolishness in this issue – just a quick recap of the week's most important events. </p>

<p>As you recall, we officially announced that the CloudStack project was graduating from the incubator last week. Though there were no events quite of that magnitude this week, there was plenty of discussion of new features, a new Website design proposal, and Chiradeep Vittal has unveiled a new tool for testing and development called QuickCloud that will come in handy for many CloudStack contributors and users.</p>

<h3><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-MajorDiscussions"></a>Major Discussions</h3>

<p>This is a summary of some of the most interesting/important discussions on the Apache CloudStack mailing lists. (Mostly dev@cloudstack.apache.org, but not excluding discussions on marketing@ and users@, of course.) This is provided as a convenient summary for folks who are not involved in day-to-day development of Apache CloudStack – if you're working on CloudStack or would like to get involved in development, we highly recommend being subscribed to dev@cloudstack.apache.org and keeping close tabs on the list!</p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-WebsiteReDesignDiscussion"></a>Website Re-Design Discussion</h5>

<p>Sonny Chhen has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/rfgclvkfz6qtgy33" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">submitted a second mock-up design for the front page of the Apache CloudStack Web site</a> which has been met with quite a lot of enthusiasm. </p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-Quickcloud:ZerotoCloudinLessthanaMinute!"></a>Quickcloud: Zero to Cloud in Less than a Minute! </h5>

<p>Chiradeep Vittal has developed Quickcloud, a <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/ajw7b6arhluqcuv2" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">much easier way</a> to start up a CloudStack cloud on a single box. <a href="http://markmail.org/message/weqbozgay44v3bro" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Chiradeep announced on March 26th that QuickCloud is in a "rough-but-ready state"</a> for developers to try out.  </p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-EIPAcrossZones"></a>EIP Across Zones</h5>

<p>Discussion <a href="http://markmail.org/message/6licrw7dve4f674h" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">continued</a> on Murali Reddy's <a href="http://markmail.org/message/flx3romoalsu5oiu" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">proposal</a> to enhance the EIP functionality to work at the region level. This week, Murali explained in more detail what he was thinking:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CloudStack need not have a native capability to move IP across zone. From the CloudStack core perspective, all we need is abstraction of moving IP (presented as NAT) across the zones. Then we can have specific intelligence in the plug-ins which are providing EIP service. For e.g.'Route Health Injection' is commonly used solution in distributed data centres for disaster recovery supported by multiple vendors.</p></blockquote>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-UpgradeProcessfrom4.0.xto4.1.0"></a>Upgrade Process from 4.0.x to 4.1.0</h5>

<p>Wido den Hollander <a href="http://markmail.org/message/5at5p2hasjltkt5z" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">started a discussion about how upgrades will work</a> for 4.0.x to 4.1.0, given the package renaming taking place in 4.1.0. See the discussion on the mailing list and <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Ubuntu+upgrade+process" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">docs in progress on the wiki</a>. </p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-ProposedFeatures:ACLonPrivateGatewayandEgressFirewallRulesforSRX"></a>Proposed Features: ACL on Private Gateway and Egress Firewall Rules for SRX</h5>

<p>Jayapal Reddy Uradi <a href="http://markmail.org/message/3p5gwarljkqxlf4m" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">has proposed a new feature ACL on the private gateway</a>. Says Jayapal, "Currently we do not have way to control the traffic on the private gateway. Using this feature we can configure the ingress/egress ACL on the private gateway." </p>

<p>Jayapal has also proposed <a href="http://markmail.org/message/e6yrbl2b7rehk2g4" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">egress firewall rules for the external firewall device, SRX</a>. </p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-JenkinsUpgrade"></a>Jenkins Upgrade</h5>

<p>Prasanna Santhanam has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/h5dmrprwyswuq5fv" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">pointed out a few bugs that were affecting build jobs</a>. Jenkins.cloudstack.org has been upgraded.</p>
