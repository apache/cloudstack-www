<p>Flexible, scalable, Open Source Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) used by organizations such as Zynga, Datapipe, and ISWest, among others, for creating, managing, and deploying public, private, and hybrid Cloud Computing environments</p>

<p>Forest Hill, MD --25 March 2014-- The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 170 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced Apache CloudStack v4.3, the latest feature release of the CloudStack cloud orchestration platform.</p>

<p>Apache CloudStack is an integrated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) software platform that allows users to build feature-rich public, private, and hybrid cloud environments. CloudStack includes an intuitive user interface and rich APIs for managing the compute, networking, software, and storage infrastructure resources. CloudStack became an Apache Top-level Project (TLP) in March 2013.
"We are proud to announce CloudStack v4.3," said Hugo Trippaers, Vice President of Apache CloudStack. "This release represents over six months of work from the Apache CloudStack community with many new and improved features."</p>
