## A Note from CloudStack VP

"CloudStack meetups are fantastic events where our community of users, contributors, vendors and integrators can come together, collaborate, network and showcase what they are doing with CloudStack, talk about their use-cases, offerings, problems and solutions.

Our meetups attendees benefit from catching up with the latest developments in the CloudStack ecosystem as well as learn about real-world use of CloudStack from actual users, learn about their interesting solutions, integrations and meet them face to face. It's just a great place to be at for anybody using CloudStack or considering to build a private cloud."
