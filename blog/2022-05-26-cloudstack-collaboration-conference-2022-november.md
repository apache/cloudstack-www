<p>For the 10<sup>th</sup> consecutive year, the Apache CloudStack community is organising its major event - CloudStack Collaboration Conference, running from 14<sup>th</sup> to 16<sup>th</sup> November 2022. The event will be a hybrid event, giving attendees and speakers the option to join in Sofia, Bulgaria (Exact location TBD) or remotely from their computers. By doing so, the conference will allow more people from the Apache CloudStack community and people interested in the technology, to learn more about it and its latest capabilities and integrations.</p>
<p>The hybrid event is aimed at developers, operators and users to discuss and evolve the open-source software project, its functionality and real-world operability. This event will introduce you to the CloudStack family, community leaders, project members and contributors.</p>
<p>CloudStack Collaboration Conference welcomes attendees from all over the globe. Our core audience is enterprises, cloud service providers, telcos and MSPs. Every region sends its best and brightest to share insights and knowledge on open-source technology, orchestrating public and private clouds, building IaaS.</p>
<p>The 2022 edition of the CloudStack Collaboration Conference comes as a 3-day conference, with the schedule to be determined. The Call for Presentations is currently open, so if you are interested in presenting, then you should submit it as soon as possible to maximise the chance of being accepted.
