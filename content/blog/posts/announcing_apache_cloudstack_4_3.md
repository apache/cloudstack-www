<p>Flexible, scalable, Open Source Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) used by organizations such as Zynga, Datapipe, and ISWest, among others, for creating, managing, and deploying public, private, and hybrid Cloud Computing environments</p>

<p>Forest Hill, MD --25 March 2014-- The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 170 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced Apache CloudStack v4.3, the latest feature release of the CloudStack cloud orchestration platform.</p>

<p>Apache CloudStack is an integrated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) software platform that allows users to build feature-rich public, private, and hybrid cloud environments. CloudStack includes an intuitive user interface and rich APIs for managing the compute, networking, software, and storage infrastructure resources. CloudStack became an Apache Top-level Project (TLP) in March 2013.
"We are proud to announce CloudStack v4.3," said Hugo Trippaers, Vice President of Apache CloudStack. "This release represents over six months of work from the Apache CloudStack community with many new and improved features."</p>

<h3>Under The Hood</h3>
<p>CloudStack V4.3 is the next feature release of the 4.x line which first released on November 6, 2012. Some of the noteworthy new and improved features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for Microsoft Hyper-V - Apache CloudStack can now manage Hyper-V hypervisors in addition to KVM, XenServer, VMware, LXC, and Bare Metal</li>
<li>Juniper OpenContrail integration - OpenContrail is a software defined networking controller from Juniper that CloudStack now integrates with to provide SDN services</li>
