<p><strong>AGENDA</strong></p>
<p><strong>09:30 &ndash; 09:45 &ndash; Welcome + CloudStack News &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>Giles Sirett, Chairman CSEUG,&nbsp; PMC member, Apache CloudStack</p>
<p>Giles Sirett will be giving an outline of what everyone can expect for the day. Join the official event opening to learn more about the upcoming sessions, speakers and networking events. Discover also the latest news from the CloudStack Community!</p>
<p><strong>09:45- 10:30 &ndash; CloudStack with Ansible,&nbsp;</strong>Rene Moser</p>
<p>This call involves a brief introduction about how it all began and how the project stands today including a real-world example of how Ngine.io have managed workloads with Ansible on Exoscale.</p>
<p><strong>10:40 &ndash; 11:25 &ndash; Leveraging CloudStack and Apiculus to Launch and Operate a Profitable Public Cloud Business, </strong>Sunando Bhattacharya, IndiQus</p>
<p>Learn more about the learnings of IndiQus Technologies from working with 20+ cloud operators across the globe. CloudStack has been powering numerous cloud providers globally for over a decade. In this talk, Sunando Bhattacharya, CEO of IndiQus, will be delving into the primary reasons why CSPs are preferring it over the OtherStack and how IndiQus is combining CloudStack with their platform Apiculus, to deliver a Cloud Business platform. He will also be sharing some user stories about how some of his company&rsquo;s customers revolutionized the cloud business in their respective countries, thereby busting some myths about the IaaS business.</p>
<p><strong>11:35 &ndash; 12:20 &ndash; Building a DR Solution with CloudStack, </strong>Venko Moyankov, StorPool</p>
<p>Building a Disaster Recovery solution with KVM is not trivial. In this talk, Venko Moyankov will present how CloudStack cloud management and StorPool Storage can be used to build a multi-datacentre cloud with Disaster Recovery capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>12:30 &ndash; 13:15 &ndash; VM Job Queues in CloudStack,&nbsp;</strong>Suresh Kumar Anaparti, Software Engineer, ShapeBlue</p>
<p>CloudStack allows various life cycle operations for a Virtual Machine (VM). It maintains queues internally, to sync and perform all these operations. This talk briefs about how job queues are maintained in CloudStack, to execute the VM operations, followed by a demo.</p>
<p><strong>13:25 &ndash; 13:55 &ndash; Security in Shared Networks with VMware NSX, </strong>Alireza Eskandari, Afranet</p>
<p>Shared networks security can be a serious concern if different untrusted tenants use it together. Alireza will discuss Afranet&rsquo;s solution for IP and DHCP spoofing for these networks on VMware environments which are managed by CloudStack.</p>
<p><strong>14:05 &ndash; 14:50 &ndash; Integrating CyberSecurity Active Measures into CloudStack Kubernetes Service, </strong>Jesus Escolar, Exelerys</p>
<p>There is a constant rise in Cloud Native adoption. Most companies are evaluating how to migrate to newer, flexible, and automated platforms. Cloud-Native provides the answer, as well as the complications. Cloud-Native solutions are building themselves alone across the business, but who's securing them? Jesus will discuss the evolution of infrastructure solutions to Cloud Native, how can they be secured on CloudStack, what opensource security options are available today for CloudStack and where the future is leading towards Cloud Native security for CloudStack.</p>
<p><strong>15:00 &ndash; 15:30 &ndash; Boosting I/O Performance with KVM io_uring, </strong>Wido den Hollander, CLDIN B.V.<u></u></p>
<p>Storage performance is becoming much more important. KVM io_uring attempts to bring the I/O performance of a virtual machine to almost the same level as bare metal. Apache CloudStack has support for io_uring since version 4.16. Wido will show the difference in performance io_uring brings to the table.</p>
<p><strong>15:40 &ndash; 16:10 &ndash; Backup and Restore VMs based on KVM, </strong>Quentin Roccia &amp; Joffrey Luangsaysana, Dimsi</p>
<p>Dimsi has developed a backup solution for Virtual Machines based on KVM hypervisors. Every layer of the product uses Open Source libraries or components (Python, VueJS, Celery, Borg Backup, Redis, Socketio, Flask). There is no agent needed on the VMs. Dimsi has implemented a feature to group the hosts based on their use (CloudStack Hosts or Management Hosts) and apply specific policies to the groups. In the CloudStack context, this product can help you backup and restore all your VMs easily if the hypervisors are KVM-based. Moreover, restoring the VMs is effortless because KVM and CloudStack use the same id for the VM disks, so no need to hack the database to match them.</p>
<p><strong>16:20 &ndash; 17:05 &ndash; A Kubernetes CAPI Provider for Apache CloudStack, </strong>Peter (Motyka) Motykowski, Sr. Software Development Manager &ndash; Customer Engineering at Amazon Web Services (AWS)</p>
<p>Discover the new Kubernetes CAPI (Cluster-API) provider for Apache CloudStack "CAPC", enabling you to manage a range of Kubernetes clusters across Apache CloudStack and other supported infrastructure providers!CAPI is a Kubernetes sub-project focused on providing declarative APIs and tooling to simplify provisioning, upgrading, and operating multiple Kubernetes clusters. Started by the Kubernetes SIG (Special Interest Group) Cluster Lifecycle, the CAPI project uses Kubernetes-style APIs and patterns to automate cluster lifecycle management for platform operators. CAPI relies on infrastructure providers to provision the underlying infrastructure components.<br />In this talk, you will find out more about the newly developed provider, its capabilities, and how you can benefit from it!</p>
<p><strong>17:15 &ndash; 17:45 &ndash; Expose Router VM Statistics to Customers, </strong>Sina Kashipazha, Leaseweb</p>
<p>In recent years, some of Leaseweb&rsquo;s customers complained about the router VM resource usage and its availability. This made the company think that it would be nice to expose router VM statistics to the customers using the Prometheus format. In that way, they can set up their monitoring system and have more visibility over their network. Although it is still under development, Leaseweb thought it would be nice to discuss the project with the community members and gather feedback.</p>
<p><strong>17:45 &ndash; 19:00 &ndash; Networking and Beers</strong></p>
