<p><strong>Introduce yourself with a few words</strong></p>
<p>I am K B Shiv Kumar and am the Co-Founder and CTO at IndiQus. I am based out of Delhi, India and am passionate about travelling and dig going on driving holidays with my friends and family. I love listening to music and ABBA has been my all-time favourite band since childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us your story in one Tweet?</strong></p>
<p>As a commerce graduate, moving to an IT career accidentally was probably the best thing that happened to me. I subsequently completed my masters in software engineering and worked as a developer with different ISPs where my interest in infrastructure programming was kindled.</p>
<p><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong></p>
<p>My first exposure to CloudStack was in 2013 and since then I have embarked on a very exciting journey where I have evolved from a CloudStack user to an evangelist. I love tinkering on CloudStack and the techno-commercial possibilities it offers to the regional Internet, Cloud and Data Center providers.</p>
<p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong></p>
<p>I have received a lot of help from the community. If I must take a single name, it would be Rohit Yadav. He has been my mentor and will probably remain so for a while as far as CloudStack is concerned. During my initial days, folks from Citrix helped me a lot too, Vimmy Hong for one.</p>
<p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong></p>
<p>My commitment to CloudStack has been indirect but impacting. It has been taking it to the industry &ndash; the enterprises, telecoms, ISPs and data centre providers and showcasing how CloudStack can be leveraged as a viable cloud business model and implementing the same across various geographies. My organisation&rsquo;s product offering is completely architected by leveraging CloudStack and transforming it into a techno-commercial solution.</p>
<p>On the technical side, I have worked extensively on various aspects of monitoring CloudStack and shared the same amongst the community. I am currently looking to implement an outside-in way of monitoring VRs and providing auto-scale facilities without modifying the CloudStack code.</p>
<p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cost-effective, allows unmatched customising flexibility and it works! It&rsquo;s that simple. Since it&rsquo;s community-driven, it is always balanced. The collective intelligence of the community is always greater than the sum of each individual&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>
<p>Many pairs of eyes mean tighter, more secure, more relevant and more efficient code. Your choice to pay for support is completely de-linked from the licence to use the product. What&rsquo;s more, there are a plethora of licences to choose from to leverage the same in your own product/service offering.
