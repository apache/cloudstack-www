<p><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/mediaresource/ab378739-3c34-48ea-9495-2c49e23e58d6"><img src="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/mediaresource/ab378739-3c34-48ea-9495-2c49e23e58d6?t=true" alt="square-cloudmonkey.png" align="left" vspace="4" hspace="5"></img></a>The Apache CloudStack is very near to the 4.1.0 release, and as a result we&#8217;re conducting a vote on artifacts for the 4.1.0 release right now. Because we want to make sure we have the best possible release, we&#8217;d like to invite anyone who&#8217;s interested in CloudStack to take the current release candidate for a test drive. </p>

<p>Chip Childers <a href="http://markmail.org/message/me3q3zjskhcwmfn5">started the vote on May 28th</a> and it will run for a minimum of 72 hours, barring any blockers. Note that a VOTE requires at least three +1 votes from PMC members to pass, but <em>anyone</em> can vote, and we welcome input from <em>all</em> members of the community &ndash; positive votes mean that a wider community has taken a look at the release and helped vet it before we make it official. And if there are technical issues that might be a &#8211;1 on the release, we&#8217;ll take a look at those regardless of whether a person is a PMC member or a member of the community speaking up for the first time.</p>

<p>The source release is available on dist.apache.org: <a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/cloudstack/4.1.0/">https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/cloudstack/4.1.0/</a>, and the list of CHANGES is <a href="https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cloudstack.git;a=blob_plain;f=CHANGES;hb=4.1">available via our git repository</a>. </p>

<p>Full <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/CLOUDSTACK/release-test-procedure.html">testing instructions are available on the CloudStack wiki</a>. </p>

<p>Please be sure to send any feedback via the <a href="http://markmail.org/message/me3q3zjskhcwmfn5">VOTE thread</a> on dev@cloudstack.apache.org. We&#8217;re looking forward to getting the 4.1.0 release out the door, come and give us a hand!</p>
