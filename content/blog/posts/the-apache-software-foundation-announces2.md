It is important for us to see the Open Source community bringing more and more features that allow us to enhance our global cloud operations capabilities."

"Apache CloudStack continues to bring innovative features for public cloud providers like us,"  said Wido den Hollander, CTO of PCExtreme.

The fact that the CloudStack community is driven by users of the software as opposed to vendors with competing interests means that time and time again we see these exciting features delivered In Apache CloudStack."
