<p><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/mediaresource/3b5a1e4e-90cb-469e-a58a-512bdcc28007"><img src="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/mediaresource/3b5a1e4e-90cb-469e-a58a-512bdcc28007?t=true" alt="acwn-icon.png" align="left"></img></a>Apache CloudStack <em>has graduated</em> from the Apache Incubator! The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) board met on Wednesday (March 20) and voted in favor of the project's graduation from the incubator. The official announcement <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/the_apache_software_foundation_announces" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">was released on Monday, March 25, 2013</a>. </p>

<p>Of course, that's not all that's happened. in the past week. Work on the 4.1.0 release continues, with the first RC date slipping slightly due to the number of blocker bugs. The good news is that a lot of progress has been made on the blocker bugs in the past week, so things don't appear to be <b>too</b> far behind. </p>

<p>With the graduation, note that locations have changed for many resources (including the git repository) and the <a href="http://markmail.org/message/l3rc74krizsgcw4x" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">list address have changed as well</a>. For instance, cloudstack-dev@incubator.apache.org is now dev@cloudstack.apache.org. See the full list of address here on <a href="http://cloudstack.apache.org/mailing-lists.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">cloudstack.apache.org</a>. </p>

<p>Some of the major discussions and issues that have taken place on dev@, marketing@, and users@ in the past week. This is by no means exhaustive, if you need to be up-to-date on all development issues in the project, you'll definitely want to be subscribed to the mailing lists! Remember <em>if it didn't happen on the mailing list, it didn't happen</em> also means that participants are expected to keep current with the mailing lists, or expect decisions to be made in their absence.</p>

<p>Chip Childers <a href="http://markmail.org/message/lfkhazcc77mpy62e" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">announced on Wednesday</a> that the board has passed the graduation resolution. And there was much rejoicing!</p>

<p>The bare metal support in Apache CloudStack 4.1.0 <a href="http://markmail.org/message/lwpscjn67myiwebk" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">had a number of blockers against it</a> that meant it was unlikely to be of release quality. <a href="http://markmail.org/message/adwxnxrlhtdfrzx7" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">A patch has been applied</a> to disable the functionality.</p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-25March2012-SystemVMsOptionalforQuickCloud"></a>System VMs Optional for QuickCloud</h5>

<p>Chiradeep Vittal has <a href="http://markmail.org/message/ajw7b6arhluqcuv2" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">proposed making the system VMs optional</a> to allow a cloud to start faster. </p>

<p>Prasanna Santhanam <a href="http://markmail.org/message/rqghmg5s4gks27wd" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">provided an update on the BVT work</a> this week. Prasanna says "this work is now on the bvt branch. Since this puts together python and maven which don't seem to interact in a friendly way I'd like some help testing in other developer environments to fix possible failures."</p>

<h5><a name="ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-25March2012-UsingLanyrdtoTrackApacheCloudStackEvents"></a>Using Lanyrd to Track Apache CloudStack Events</h5>

<p>On the marketing@ list, Joe Brockmeier <a href="http://markmail.org/message/3hib3fe7qtimhdb7" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">proposed using Lanyrd to track Apache CloudStack events</a> rather than trying to use the wiki or a static page on the Apache CMS site. You can find the events tagged with Apache CloudStack <a href="http://lanyrd.com/topics/apache-cloudstack/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">on Lanyrd's Apache CloudStack topic page</a> and add new events to that topic. Note that an event need not be exclusively about Apache CloudStack, but should have one or more talks about Apache CloudStack at the event and/or speakers from the project.</p>
