<h1>Apache CloudStack: Getting Involved</h1>

Interested in helping out with Apache CloudStack? Great! We welcome
participation from anybody willing to work [The Apache
Way](https://theapacheway.com/) and make a contribution.

Note that you **do not have to be a developer** in order to contribute to Apache
CloudStack. We need folks to help with documentation, translation, promotion,
and having someone with snazzy Web design skills would not be a bad thing! Want
to give a talk about Apache CloudStack, or even organize a CloudStack event?
[We're all ears &ndash; join us on the Marketing list and we'll help you get
started](/mailing-lists)!

Developers, of course, are also welcome. See the [Developer
Resources](/developers) page!

If you just want to report a bug, that's easily done in our [GitHub project
issues list](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues). Go there and click
[new issue](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/new/choose).
