<h1> About Apache CloudStack</h1>

<h2>What is Apache CloudStack?</h2>

Apache CloudStack is a top-level project of the Apache Software Foundation
(ASF). The project develops open source software for deploying public and
private Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds.

It is designed to deploy and manage large networks of virtual machines, as a
highly available, highly scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud
computing platform. CloudStack is used by a number of service providers to offer
public cloud services, and by many companies to provide an on-premises (private)
cloud offering, or as part of a hybrid cloud solution.

CloudStack is a turnkey solution that includes the entire "stack" of features
most organizations want with an IaaS cloud: compute orchestration,
Network-as-a-Service, user and account management, a full and open native API,
resource accounting, and a first-class User Interface (UI).

CloudStack currently supports the most popular hypervisors: KVM, VMware, Citrix
XenServer/Hypervisor, XCP-ng, Oracle VM server and Microsoft Hyper-V.

Users can manage their cloud with an easy to use Web interface, command line
tools, and/or a full-featured RESTful API. In addition, CloudStack provides an
API that's compatible with AWS EC2 and S3 for organizations that wish to deploy
hybrid clouds.

CloudStack provides an open and flexible cloud orchestration platform to deliver
reliable and scalable private and public clouds. What's that *mean*, exactly?

<h2>Features and Functionality</h2>

Apache CloudStack is a Java-based project that provides a management server and
agents (if needed) for hypervisor hosts so that you can run an IaaS cloud. Some,
but not all, of the features and functionality provided by CloudStack:

- Works with hosts running XenServer/XCP, KVM, Hyper-V, and/or VMware ESXi with vSphere
- Provides a friendly Web-based UI for managing the cloud
- Provides a native [API](/api/)
- May provide an Amazon S3/EC2 compatible API (optional)
- Manages storage for instances running on the hypervisors (primary storage) as well as templates, snapshots, and ISO images (secondary storage)
- Orchestrates network services from the data link layer (L2) to some application layer (L7) services, such as DHCP, NAT, firewall, VPN, and so on
- Accounting of network, compute, and storage resources
- Multi-tenancy/account separation
- User management

In short, organizations can use Apache CloudStack to deploy a full-featured
public or private IaaS cloud.

<h2>People of Apache CloudStack</h2>

Apache projects are managed by a [Project Management
Committee](https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#what-is-a-pmc) (PMC), and much of
the work is done by the project's
[committers](https://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html). Note that committer
status is *not* limited to developers, but is conferred to individuals who have
made sustained contributions of high quality, and have shown a commitment to
mentoring other contributors and following [The Apache
Way](https://theapacheway.com).

The current Vice President of Apache CloudStack and chair of the PMC, along with
the full list of PMC members and committer contributors is available on the
*[Who We Are](/who)* page.
