<h1>Apache CloudStack: Mailing Lists</h1>

If you're interested in learning more or participating in the Apache CloudStack
project, the mailing lists are the best way to do that. While the project has
several communications channels, the mailing lists are the most active and the
official channels for making decisions about the project itself. *["If it didn't
happen on a mailing list, it didn't
happen."](https://community.apache.org/newbiefaq.html#is-there-a-code-of-conduct-for-apache-projects)*

The project currently has several lists:

- [announce@](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?announce@cloudstack.apache.org): Project release, security and other announcements. This is a very low volume list.
- [users@](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?users@cloudstack.apache.org): This list is for users of CloudStack to seek and provide support. This is a moderately high volume list.
- [dev@](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@cloudstack.apache.org): Where discussions about development and the project itself happen. This is a high volume list.
- [commits@](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?commits@cloudstack.apache.org): This list is for commits to the CloudStack git repository. It's a high volume list with automated messages, probably of limited interest to anyone who is not actively developing Apache CloudStack.
- [issues@](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?issues@cloudstack.apache.org): Notifications from CloudStack's Jira project. This is a high volume list.
- [marketing@](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?marketing@cloudstack.apache.org): Discussions about marketing CloudStack.
