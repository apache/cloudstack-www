                <p>
Apache CloudStack is a top-level project of the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF). The project develops open source software for
deploying public and private Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
clouds.  <br/> CloudStack provides an open and flexible cloud
orchestration platform to deliver reliable and scalable private and
public clouds. What does that <strong>mean</strong>, exactly?
                </p>
                <p>
Apache CloudStack is a Java-based project that provides a management
server and agents (if needed) for hypervisor hosts so that you can run
an IaaS cloud. Some, but not all, of the features and functionality
provided by CloudStack:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
Works with hosts running XenServer/XCP, KVM, Hyper-V, and/or VMware
ESXi with vSphere
                  </li>
                  <li>
Provides a friendly Web-based UI for managing the cloud
                  </li>
                  <li>
Provides a native <a href="/api" alt="api overview">API</a>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
May provide an Amazon S3/EC2 compatible API (optional)
                  </li>
                  <li>
Manages storage for instances running on the hypervisors (primary
storage) as well as templates, snapshots, and ISO images (secondary
storage)
                  </li>
                  <li>
Orchestrates network services from the data link layer (L2) to some
application layer (L7) services, such as DHCP, NAT, firewall, VPN, and
so on
                  </li>
                  <li>
Accounting of network, compute, and storage resources
                  </li>
                  <li>
Multi-tenancy/account separation
                  </li>
                  <li>
User management
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
In short, organizations can use Apache CloudStack to deploy a
full-featured public or private IaaS cloud.
