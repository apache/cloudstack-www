# Apache CloudStack Official Website

This project keeps all sources used for building up Apache CloudStack
official website which's served at https://cloudstack.apache.org/.

## Prerequisite

Apache CloudStack website is powered by [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Installation

```
$ yarn install
```

## Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.

## Thanks

This site uses Docusauras and permissible images from undraw.co.
