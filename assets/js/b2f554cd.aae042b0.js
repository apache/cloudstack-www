Due to missing validation checks for KVM-compatible templates in CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.4 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.2, an attacker that can register templates, can use them to deploy malicious instances on KVM-based environments and exploit this to gain access to the host filesystems that could result in the compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality, data loss, denial of service, and availability of KVM-based infrastructure managed by CloudStack.\\n\\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.5 or 4.19.1.3, or later, which addresses this issue.\\n\\nAdditionally, all user-registered KVM-compatible templates can be scanned and checked that they are flat files that should not be using any additional or unnecessary features. For example, operators can run the following command on their file-based primary storage(s) and inspect the output. An empty output for the disk being validated means it has no references to the host filesystems; on the other hand, if the output for the disk being validated is not empty, it might indicate a compromised disk. However, bear in mind that (i) volumes created from templates will have references for the templates at first and (ii) volumes can be consolidated while migrating, losing their references to the templates. Therefore, the command execution for the primary storages can show both false positives and false negatives.\\n\\n```\\nfor file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\\\\-]*.*); do echo \\"Retrieving file [$file] info. If the output is not empty, that might indicate a compromised disk; check it carefully.\\"; qemu-img info -U $file | grep file: ; printf \\"\\\\n\\\\n\\"; done\\n```\\n\\nFor checking the whole template/volume features of each disk, operators can run the following command:\\n\\n```\\nfor file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\\\\-]*.*); do echo \\"Retrieving file [$file] info.\\"; qemu-img info -U $file; printf \\"\\\\n\\\\n\\"; done\\n```\\n\\n## Credits\\n\\nThe CVEs are credited to the following reporters:\\n\\n- CVE-2024-50386:\\n  - Kiran Chavala <kiranchavala@apache.org> (reporter)\\n\\n## Affected versions:\\n\\n- CVE-2024-50386:\\n  - Apache CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.4\\n  - Apache CloudStack 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.2\\n\\n## Resolution\\n\\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.2.5, 4.19.1.3 or later, which addresses this issue.

Due to missing validation checks for KVM-compatible templates or volumes in CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.3 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1, an attacker that can upload or register templates and volumes, can use them to deploy malicious instances or attach uploaded volumes to their existing instances on KVM-based environments and exploit this to gain access to the host filesystems that could result in the compromise of resource integrity and confidentiality, data loss, denial of service, and availability of KVM-based infrastructure managed by CloudStack.\\n\\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.4 or 4.19.1.2, or later, which addresses this issue.\\n\\nAdditionally, all user-uploaded or registered KVM-compatible templates and volumes can be scanned and checked that they are flat files that should not be using any additional or unnecessary features. For example, operators can run this on their secondary storage(s) and inspect output. An empty output for the disk being validated means it has no references to the host filesystems; on the other hand, if the output for the disk being validated is not empty, it might indicate a compromised disk.\\n\\n```\\nfor file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\\\\-]*.*); do echo \\"Retrieving file [$file] info. If the output is not empty, that might indicate a compromised disk; check it carefully.\\"; qemu-img info -U $file | grep file: ; printf \\"\\\\n\\\\n\\"; done\\n```\\n\\nThe command can also be run for the file-based primary storages; however, bear in mind that (i) volumes created from templates will have references for the templates at first and (ii) volumes can be consolidated while migrating, losing their references to the templates. Therefore, the command execution for the primary storages can show both false positives and false negatives.\\n\\nFor checking the whole template/volume features of each disk, operators can run the following command:\\n\\n```\\nfor file in $(find /path/to/storage/ -type f -regex [a-f0-9\\\\-]*.*); do echo \\"Retrieving file [$file] info.\\"; qemu-img info -U $file; printf \\"\\\\n\\\\n\\"; done\\n```\\n\\n\\n## [CVE-2024-45461](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45461): Access checks not enforced in Quota\\n\\nThe CloudStack Quota feature allows cloud administrators to implement a quota or usage limit system for cloud resources, and is disabled by default. In environments where the feature is enabled, due to missing access check enforcements, non-administrative CloudStack user accounts are able to access and modify quota-related configurations and data. This issue affects Apache CloudStack from 4.7.0 through 4.18.2.3; and from 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1, where the Quota feature is enabled.\\n\\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.4 or 4.19.1.2, or later, which addresses this issue. Alternatively, users that do not use the Quota feature are advised to disabled the plugin by setting the global setting \\"quota.enable.service\\" to \\"false\\".\\n\\n## [CVE-2024-45462](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45462): Incomplete session invalidation on web interface logout\\n\\nThe logout operation in the CloudStack web interface does not expire the user session completely which is valid until expiry by time or restart of the backend service. An attacker that has access to a user\'s browser can use an unexpired session to gain access to resources owned by the logged out user account. This issue affects Apache CloudStack from 4.15.1.0 through 4.18.2.3; and from 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1.\\n\\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.4 or 4.19.1.2, or later, which addresses this issue.\\n\\n## [CVE-2024-45693](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45693): Request origin validation bypass makes account takeover possible\\n\\nUsers logged into the Apache CloudStack\'s web interface can be tricked to submit malicious CSRF requests due to missing validation of the origin of the requests. This can allow an attacker to gain privileges and access to resources of the authenticated users and may lead to account takeover, disruption, exposure of sensitive data and compromise integrity of the resources owned by the user account that are managed by the platform.\\n\\nThis issue affects Apache CloudStack from 4.15.1.0 through 4.18.2.3 and 4.19.0.0 through 4.19.1.1\\n\\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.18.2.4 or 4.19.1.2, or later, which addresses this issue.\\n\\n## Credits\\n\\nThe CVEs are credited to the following reporters:\\n\\n- CVE-2024-45219:\\n  - Daniel Augusto Veronezi Salvador (<gutoveronezi@apache.org>)\\n\\n- CVE-2024-45461:\\n  - Fabr\xedcio Duarte (<fabricio.duarte.jr@gmail.com>)\\n\\n- CVE-2024-45462:\\n  - Arthur Souza\\n  - Felipe Olivaes\\n\\n- CVE-2024-45693:\\n  - Arthur Souza\\n  - Felipe Olivaes\\n\\n## Affected versions:\\n\\n\\n- CVE-2024-45219:\\n  - Apache CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.18.2.3\\n  - Apache CloudStack 4.0.0 through 4.19.1.1\\n\\n- CVE-2024-45461:\\n  - Apache CloudStack 4.7.0 through 4.18.2.3\\n  - Apache CloudStack 4.7.0 through 4.19.1.1\\n\\n- CVE-2024-45462:\\n  - Apache CloudStack 4.15.1.0 through 4.18.2.3\\n  - Apache CloudStack 4.15.1.0 through 4.19.1.1\\n\\n- CVE-2024-45693:\\n  - Apache CloudStack 4.15.1.0 through 4.18.2.3\\n  - Apache CloudStack 4.15.1.0 through 4.19.1.1\\n\\n## Resolution\\n\\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.2.4, 4.19.1.2 or later, which addresses these issues.

In this new role, Daniel is entrusted with\\nensuring the health and growth of both the project and its community,\\nguiding its further development while fostering a collaborative\\nenvironment.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIn our exclusive interview with Daniel, we explore the\\nresponsibilities and vision he brings to this role. As he explains,\\nthe VP\u2019s primary duty is to serve as a liaison, ensuring effective\\ncommunication and alignment between the CloudStack community and the\\nASF board. Despite holding this significant title, Daniel emphasizes\\nthat the VP role carries no extra privilege or weight in\\ndecision-making compared to other Project Management Committee (PMC)\\nmembers. His focus will be on maintaining a healthy community and\\nsteering the project towards its future goals.\\n\\nCloudStack has been a game-changer for many companies, particularly\\nthose seeking an easy-to-deploy, robust cloud management\\nsolution. With its latest enhancements, including advanced billing and\\nwhite-label capabilities, CloudStack is ideal for digital service\\nproviders and companies managing large-scale virtual machine (VM)\\nenvironments. Telecom companies and cloud providers, in particular,\\nstand to benefit from CloudStack\'s ability to streamline VM\\nmanagement, enhance security, and provide detailed cost and resource\\ntracking. Read the full interview below.\\n\\n#### What exactly is the role of VP of Apache CloudStack?\\n\\nThe main role of a VP is to interface between the community/project\\nand the ASF board. The VP is not different from the other PMC members;\\ntherefore, there is no privilege or greater weight in decisions for\\nthe person acting as VP. However, the VP is entrusted with\\nguaranteeing the health of the community and also guiding the further\\ndevelopment of the project and its community.\\n\\n#### CloudStack has played a critical role for many solutions providers and companies seeking ease of use and deployment. Which companies can benefit the most from CloudStack?\\n\\nThe latest billing and white-label capabilities make Apache CloudStack\\nan ideal choice for cloud and digital service providers. However, for\\nany company that needs to manage virtual machines (VMs) to run their\\nworkloads, CloudStack can help them to better visualize costs and the\\nworkloads and ease their management while adding security mechanisms,\\nawareness of the resources applied in each project/application, and\\nauditing tools with respect to infrastructure changes in the VMs where\\nthey run. The most benefits of CloudStack come when one needs to\\nsupport large cloud environments. Therefore, CloudStack is a reliable\\nalternative for companies that handle several sites, like Telecoms and\\ncloud providers.\\n\\n![](Daniel-inside.png \\"Blog Quote: Cloud computing is a fundamental\\ntechnology for organizations that aspire to optimize their data center\\noperations. As a whole, CloudStack excels in orchestrating cloud\\nenvironments; it has been the choice of many companies for years. With\\nadequate maintenance and development of the project, CloudStack will\\nbecome the cornerstone of most cloud providers.\\")\\n\\n#### Choosing a cloud management system is a hard thing, especially if you have a long history with specific technologies. Why should companies migrate to CloudStack?\\n\\nBefore choosing a technology to adopt as the basis of the cloud, the\\nservice provider needs to define its requirements, look for\\nalternatives, and understand how it can address its needs. It all\\ndepends on the list of requirements, and the operating team that the\\ncompany has. Most time, digital services companies will find out that\\nCloudStack is the best option, with its easy-to-use graphical\\ninterface, market-ready structure, advanced features, reduced\\noperating costs, and so on.\\n\\n#### On the development side, how easy it is to implement and manage CloudStack?\\n\\nOnce you understand the CloudStack code structure, it is not\\nhard. However, we (the community) have to understand that we have\\nseveral development barriers. We are already working with a highly\\ncomplex context; to work with CloudStack, developers need to\\nunderstand storage, networking, virtualization, Internet protocols,\\nand much more. On top of that, we do not use mainstream/standardized\\nframeworks for the RESTful APIs and JPA; we use Spring in a\\nnon-standard fashion; we do not have a solid standard between our\\nAPIs, and so on. We are constantly increasing the complexity to\\nextend/evolve and maintain ACS. That creates a bubble of development\\nwhere it is hard to join, which is not healthy for a community. In\\nfact, we already had cases of people leaving the project because of\\nits barriers. I believe the first step toward removing those barriers\\nis to clearly define our subjective processes, like deprecating old\\nAPI methods, technologies, and development standards in favor of\\nmainstream/standardized frameworks and technologies. For that, we have\\na discussion running in the community, and I invite our readers to\\njoin it: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/discussions/8970.\\n\\n#### What would you share about the community?\\n\\nThe CloudStack community is very active and is always bringing new use\\ncases and innovation for the project. That is very interesting for the\\nevolution of the project. We are constantly growing and developing\\nfurther without being tied to a single vendor. That is in fact on of\\nthe reasons that attracts most organizations to Apache CloudStack. The\\ndiversity of its culture and community.\\n\\n#### How do you think we can all grow the CloudStack community?\\n\\nThe first step towards growing the community is to admit where we are\\ngoing wrong and work to fix our errors. As mentioned before, we have\\nsome development barriers; and casting light on that allows us to work\\non solutions. By doing that, we enable more people to contribute to\\nthe community more easily. We have to guarantee that all the\\ncontributors are being evaluated by the same criteria, not using\\ndouble standards. Another thing that I and my colleagues have been\\nconsidering is to host a conference in Brazil in the near\\nfuture. Latin America has lots of players in the telecom and\\ncloud-providing scenario using CloudStack as their cloud orchestrator;\\nhowever, due to several factors, not all of them participate in the\\ncommunity or attend international conferences. Therefore, promoting\\neven more CloudStack in Latin America can motivate them to participate\\nand grow the community even more here, both users and contributors.\\n\\n#### What is the direction in which Apache CloudStack is going as a technology?\\n\\nCloud computing is a fundamental technology for organizations that\\naspire to optimize their data center operations. As a whole,\\nCloudStack excels in orchestrating cloud environments; it has been the\\nchoice of many companies for years. With adequate maintenance and\\ndevelopment of the project, CloudStack will become the cornerstone of\\nmost cloud providers.\\n\\n#### Many community members notice that CloudStack is becoming more and more appealing for enterprises. What would you advise this type of organization?\\n\\nIndeed, CloudStack is becoming more appealing for large enterprise as\\n\\"brick and mortar\\" business are getting more and more\\ndigitalized. Companies running large datacenters will find out that\\nCloudStack is one of the best options, with its easy-to-use graphical\\ninterface, market-ready structure, advanced features, and so on. My\\nadvice to organizations adopting CloudStack is to study and understand\\nits powerful features and develop solutions based on CloudStack\'s\\nnumerous functionalities.\\n\\n#### As a person, you are recognized for your contribution to CloudStack. How did you start with it?\\n\\nMy CloudStack journey started in December 2020 when I started to work\\nat SC Clouds. At first, my tasks were focused on understanding how\\nCloudStack works and troubleshooting situations. \u0410fterwards, I started\\ndeveloping/improving features, reviewing patches, discussing\\nsolutions, and helping the community through the mailing lists. As I\\ngot more and more involved, my goals and focus changed, and now most\\nof my efforts are on designing features and guiding/mentoring others\\nthrough the community. Currently, I am mentoring more than 10 people\\nin the community who are my colleagues in SC Clouds.\\n\\n#### Any advice to all developers writing new features for CloudStack?\\n\\nCloudStack is a complex project; therefore, before starting the\\ndevelopment of big features, it is crucial to create a specification,\\nso that the necessary changes are mapped, structured, and\\ndocumented. We are a community with people from different places and\\nwe have different cultures, knowledge, experiences, and ways of\\nthinking. If we do not clearly document what we are doing, it gets\\nhard for others to maintain and evolve the features, creating a bubble\\nof development, which is not healthy for the community. Furthermore,\\nif one does not have a specification for the feature being developed,\\nunnecessary code might get changed. With more code touched, more\\nerrors and bugs could be introduced. Another important point is to\\nunderstand the root cause of the situations faced. It is common to see\\nPRs intended to solve a problem by adding workarounds because the root\\ncauses of the problem are never understood; however, several times\\nthose workarounds add unnecessary complexity to the project and do not\\nfully address the situation; they might even introduce other bugs and\\nsituations. It is very important to understand what is happening and\\nact precisely.\\n\\n#### If you need to summarize CloudStack in 3 words, what would they be?\\n\\nI think they would be: stable, resilient, and innovative."},{"id":"coceu-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/coceu-2024","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2024-04-22-apache-coceu-2024/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-22-apache-coceu-2024/index.md","title":"Apache Community over Code 2024 \u2013 June 3rd-5th, Bratislava, Slovakia","description":"On 3-5th June, the [Apache Software","date":"2024-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 22, 2024","tags":[{"label":"news","permalink":"/blog/tags/news"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jamie Pell","title":"Community Contributor","url":"https://github.com/jamiepell10","imageURL":"https://github.com/jamiepell10.png","key":"jamie"}],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Apache Community over Code 2024 \u2013 June 3rd-5th, Bratislava, Slovakia","tags":["news"],"authors":["jamie"],"slug":"coceu-2024"},"prevItem":{"title":"Daniel Salvador - VP of Apache CloudStack","permalink":"/blog/vp-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"Apache CloudStack Terraform 0.5.0 Release","permalink":"/blog/cloudstack-terraform-provider-0.5.0-release"}},"content":"![](banner.png \\"Blog Header Image\\")\\n\\nOn 3-5th June, the [Apache Software\\nFoundation](https://www.apache.org) will be holding the annual\\n[Community Over Code EU](https://eu.communityovercode.org/)\\nconference.

KVM is a widely used hypervisor with a\\nvibrant community and support in different operating system\\ndistributions. While developing the KVM plugin functionalities, one\\nnormally tries to make use of the full potential of the\\nhypervisor. However, while Libvirt, the toolkit used by ACS to manage\\nKVM VMs, already supports native incremental snapshots, every volume\\nsnapshot/backup taken with ACS is a full snapshot/backup. In many\\nsituations, always taking full snapshots of volumes is costly for both\\nthe storage network and storage systems. This presentation will\\naddress the design and efforts of the ACS community to support\\nincremental snapshots/backups for the KVM plugin. Thus, creating a\\nnative backup solution in ACS that supports differential copies.\\n\\n###### VNF Integration and Support in Apache CloudStack, [Wei Zhou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-zhou-3635b633/) \u2013 Tuesday 4th at 16:10 \u2013 16:40 (Harmony 1)\\n\\nIn this session, Wei will present how CloudStack 4.19 adds the\\ncapability to easily and quickly perform a light-touch integration of\\nnetworking appliances with Apache CloudStack, allowing for operators\\nand end users to offer a broader range of networking services while\\nempowering end-users to effortlessly deploy their own virtualized\\nnetwork functions (VNFs).\\n\\n###### SDN Options in Apache CloudStack, [Alexandre Mattioli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandremattiolibastos/) \u2013 Tuesday 4th at 16:50 \u2013 17:20 (Harmony 1)\\n\\nApache CloudStack integrates with two major SDN solutions, Tungsten\\nFabric (OpenSDN) for KVM environments and NSX for VMWare ESX\\nenvironments.

The company has leveraged the capabilities of Apache CloudStack to deliver a robust and scalable cloud infrastructure management solution to their customers. They also  developed is a Disaster Recovery solution, based on Apache CloudStack and Ceph.\\n\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## StackBill\u2019s Cloud Management Portal for Apache CloudStack\\n\\nStackBill\'s implementation of Apache CloudStack focuses on providing a user-friendly and efficient interface for managing cloud resources. They have developed a custom user portal that enables customers to easily provision, monitor, and manage their virtual machines and resources. The portal provides a centralized view of the entire cloud infrastructure, allowing users to efficiently allocate and optimize resources based on their requirements.\\n\\n### Resource Management\\nOne of the key strengths of StackBill\'s implementation is its robust resource management capabilities. They have integrated advanced resource scheduling algorithms into Apache CloudStack, allowing for efficient utilization of computing resources. This ensures that customers can maximize their resource allocation, minimize wastage, and ultimately reduce costs. StackBill\'s implementation also includes features such as automatic scaling, load balancing, and high availability to ensure optimal performance and reliability of the cloud infrastructure.\\n\\n### Security\\nSecurity is a top priority for StackBill, and their implementation of Apache CloudStack reflects this focus. They have incorporated robust security measures into their solution to protect customer data and ensure the integrity of the cloud environment. This includes features such as network segmentation, firewall management, and encryption to safeguard sensitive information and mitigate potential security risks.\\n\\n### Integration and Automation\\nIn addition to resource management and security, StackBill\'s implementation also emphasizes integration and automation. They have developed APIs and plugins that enable seamless integration with third-party tools and services, allowing customers to leverage their existing infrastructure investments. StackBill\'s implementation also supports automation through scripting and orchestration tools, enabling customers to automate routine tasks and streamline their cloud management workflows.\\n\\n\\n<br/>\\n<a class=\\"button button--primary button--lg\\" href=\\"/files/acs-case-study-stackbill.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Download the Case Study</a>\\n<br/>\\n\\n\\n## Cost-effective & Efficient Disaster Recovery Solution with Apache CloudStack & CEPH Storage\\n\\nStackBill identified a market need for a Disaster Recovery solution that was both cost-effective and based on open-source technologies. Proprietary DR solutions often proved to\\nbe prohibitively expensive for many organizations. A telecom company in Asia\\napproached StackBill with the specific requirement of a DR solution based on open-\\nsource technology. The objective was clear: to reduce costs, increase profitability,\\nand ensure business continuity by quickly recovering from catastrophic events.\\n\\n\\n### Apache CloudStack: A Foundation for Success\\nApache CloudStack was chosen as the cornerstone of the DR solution. This open-source cloud computing platform is highly scalable and offers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) capabilities. It provides the flexibility to deploy and manage large networks of virtual machines, making it ideal for delivering public cloud services and on-premises or hybrid cloud solutions.\\n\\n\\n### CEPH Storage: Ensuring Data Resilience\\nCeph, an open-source storage platform, was selected for its ability to offer object, block, and file storage from a single system. Its self-healing and self- managed features reduce administrative overhead, allowing it to handle outages autonomously.\\nThe decision to opt for open-source solutions was driven by the prohibitive costs and limitations of proprietary alternatives.\\n\\n\\n#### Implementation\\nThe DR solution was implemented between active zones for selective VMs. Leveraging Ceph\'s RBD Mirror Snapshot feature, the system could schedule and move data to the DR location and vice versa. StackBill\'s DR Control tool played a crucial role in managing the failover process. Importantly, this DR solution was achieved without any modifications to CloudStack. A Complete DR Solution involves compatible network and storage solutions. They have collaborated with client\u2019s network team and offered solutions with storage and StackBill.\\n\\nIn the realm of cloud computing, Disaster Recovery (DR) has historically posed significant challenges. However, StackBill\'s pioneering journey showcases the attainability of cost-effective and efficient solutions. By harnessing open-source technologies, notably Apache CloudStack and Ceph Storage, StackBill not only achieved substantial cost reductions but also fortified business continuity for its clients.\\n\\n<br/>\\n<a class=\\"button button--primary button--lg\\" href=\\"/files/acs-case-study-stackbill.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Download the Case Study</a>\\n<br/>"},{"id":"cloudstack-4.19.0.0-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/cloudstack-4.19.0.0-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2024-02-06-cloudstack-4.19.0.0-release/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-06-cloudstack-4.19.0.0-release/index.md","title":"Apache CloudStack 4.19.0.0 Release","description":"The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache CloudStack Project","date":"2024-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 6, 2024","tags":[{"label":"announcement","permalink":"/blog/tags/announcement"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jamie Pell","title":"Community Contributor","url":"https://github.com/jamiepell10","imageURL":"https://github.com/jamiepell10.png","key":"jamie"}],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Apache CloudStack 4.19.0.0 Release","tags":["announcement"],"authors":["jamie"],"slug":"cloudstack-4.19.0.0-release"},"prevItem":{"title":"Building a Disaster Recovery Solution with Apache CloudStack & CEPH Storage","permalink":"/blog/disaster-recovery-cloudstack-ceph"},"nextItem":{"title":"CloudStack and GitOps at Enterprise Scale \u2013 The Success of AT&T","permalink":"/blog/cloudstack-and-gitops-at-scale"}},"content":"[![](banner.jpeg \\"Apache CloudStack 4.19.0.0 Release\\")](/blog/cloudstack-4.19.0.0-release)\\n\\nThe Apache Software Foundation and the Apache CloudStack Project\\nAnnounces Apache\xae CloudStack\xae v4.19.\\n\\nApache CloudStack 4.19 is the most recent release of the cloud management platform.\\nIt comes as a product of extensive contributions from the development community and\\nis a LTS release, guaranteeing ongoing maintenance and support for a period of 18 months.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe 4.19 release contains 314 new features, improvements and bug fixes since 4.18, 26 of\\nthese being major features.

At risk of stating the clich\xe9 benefits of using\\nopen-source software, there are several reasons why we lean towards\\nopen-source solutions. Cost of entry is generally lower when deploying\\nopen-source which allows us to deliver solutions to the business much\\nfaster. These costs can also remain lower if there is an active\\nuser/contributor community like what we found with CloudStack.\\n\\n<strong>During your talk, you mentioned running PoCs of CloudStack and\\n  other technologies. What do you recommended to be tested during a\\n  PoC?</strong>\\n\\nWhy you chose CloudStack? Each use case is different obviously. The\\nscale of the implementation, how users will interact with the\\nplatform, how migration from present state to future state can be\\ncarried out when deploying a new cloud platform are all items we took\\ninto consideration. As mentioned, CloudStack checked several of the\\nrequirements we had: multi-tenancy capabilities, support for\\ninfrastructure as code, project quota controls, an active open-source\\ncommunity, etc.\\n\\n\\n<strong>How does CloudStack fit with the other technologies AT&T uses\\ninternally?</strong>\\n\\nCloudStack\u2019s ability to support VMWare was another reason we chose to\\ndeploy it. We have an existing VMWare footprint and we chose\\nCloudStack as a mechanism to help continue to support VMWare workloads\\nwhile also moving to a KVM-focused VM platform. For our team, it was\\nless about how CloudStack fit into our existing technology stack, as\\nthis stack has a lot of legacy, home-grown tools, and more about the\\ncapabilities CloudStack will provide as an enabler for us to move to a\\nmore modern private cloud platform.\\n\\n<strong>Do you run your datacenter ipv4 or ipv4/ipv6 or ipv6 only?</strong>\\n\\nBoth ipv4 and ipv6.\\n\\n\\n<strong>Why don\u2019t you push back your container image cloudstack mgmt\\nto the community? Do you have plans to contribute to the\\ncommunity?</strong>\\n\\nWe have already begun contributing back to the community as mentioned\\nwith our [PR for fiber channel multi-path for\\nKVM](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/7889). We will look at\\nwhat makes sense to contribute regarding the cloudstack management\\ncontainer.\\n\\n\\n<strong>What workloads are managed by CloudStack?</strong>\\n\\nOur expectation is essentially all workloads in the enterprise\\ncan/could be managed with CloudStack.

In a university, a\\nmakerspace provides students with an opportunity to build a portfolio. Students\\nexperiment through an entire development life cycle by creating prototypes for\\neach stage of a cycle. It has been shown to be a productive method for learning.\\n\\nTo the best of our knowledge, software development is yet to be included in the\\nmakerspace concept. In the case of our software makerspace, it is following the\\nsame principles as a traditional makerspace for device and mechanical\\nprototyping, but instead provides software development tools. One such\\nindispensable tool is cloud-based infrastructure. A cloud facilitates rapid\\nprototyping of machine learning tools, microservices, IoT data mining, etc.\\n\\nThis talk presents their approach to extend the concept of a makerspace to\\nsoftware development using a student developed private cloud. They present the\\nmethod they used to gather requirements from various researchers and students.\\nThey also present the final design and the current implementation of the cloud\\nusing Apache CloudStack. Finally, they discuss how other universities could\\nimplement their own software makerspace and its benefits.\\n\\n[![](youtube/19-makerspace.png \\"Building a Software Makerspace with CloudStack - video\\")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYT1HA6krU4&si=2OD0flTkxgZvRV9x&controls=0)\\n\\n[![](slides/18-kth.png \\"Building a Software Makerspace with CloudStack - slides\\")](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/ghw7Vj1Kvco7t?hostedIn=slideshare&page=upload)\\n\\n### DRBD Deep Dive, [Philipp Reisner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-reisner)\\n\\nLINSTOR/DRBD became a primary storage option for Apache CloudStack nearly two years ago. In this session, Philipp shares insights about the internals of DRBD, the data-path part of the data-storage solution.\\n\\nKnowing about DRBD\u2019s meta-data, the activity log, and the bitmap will enable you to make more educated decisions when it comes to selecting the right hardware for your next ApacheCloudStack+LINSTOR+DRBD deployment. When your servers have different storage tiers, what are the advantages and trade-offs regarding putting data and meta-data on different tiers?\\n\\nRecently, DRBD got a new transport, load-balancing TCP, that joins the existing TCP transport, and the RDMA transport received important updates. Looking beyond DRBD, what is important to know when selecting the RAID level and data alignment? Philipp concludes the session with comments regarding LVM compared to ZFS.\\n\\n[![](youtube/20-DRBD.png \\"DRBD Deep Dive - video\\")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG74BPK7oYQ&si=0B3tHBOK-DHPJKN9&controls=0)\\n\\n[![](slides/19-drbd.png \\"DRBD Deep Dive - slides\\")](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/E9cbsIaqiLwtpz?hostedIn=slideshare&page=upload)\\n\\n### Setting Up Your First CloudStack Environment with Beginners Challenges, [MD Rasel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdrasel0)\\n\\nAre you eager to embark on your journey into the world of cloud computing with Apache CloudStack but don\u2019t know where to start?

The hardware that the VMs access is implemented in\\nsoftware and/or by passing through a dedicated hardware device. Software-based\\nsolutions consume extra CPU cycles, thus resulting in poor performance. Also,\\nthese require to expose a device-model to the guest, thus increasing the attack\\nsurface. Conversely, hardware passthrough provides better performance and\\nsecurity but can be expensive in terms of the number of physical resources,\\nsince each device is dedicated to a single VM. This talk focuses on how Vates is\\nworking on sharing hardware resources among VMs by relying on dedicated\\nprocessors named Data Processing Units (DPU). More precisely, Vates work on\\noffloading Xen hypervisor of storage emulation by relying on Kalray K200 DPU\\nPCIe controllers, a hardware accelerator based on MPPA architecture.\\n\\n[![](youtube/30-DPU.png \\"Enabling DPU Hardware Accelerators in XCP-ng - video\\")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZQ2_f4FC6o&si=P7rsd8zjrN24i8JL&controls=0)\\n\\n[![](slides/28-xcpng.png \\"Enabling DPU Hardware Accelerators in XCP-ng - slides\\")](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/toAUvWJuD5HvnH?hostedIn=slideshare&page=upload)\\n\\n### CloudStack Object Storage - An Introduction, [Vladimir Petrov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimir)\\n\\nCloudStack 4.19 introduces a new framework for object storage.

This year\u2019s\\nevent will be taking place in Paris and online, on 23-24th November.\\n[Registration is still\\nopen](https://events.hubilo.com/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2023/register),\\nwith free tickets to anybody interested in the open-source project or cloud\\ntechnology. The event\u2019s agenda has also been released, which you can see when\\nregistering for the event.\\n\\nI decided to interview the project\u2019s current VP, [Rohit\\nYadav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohityadavcloud/), to get his thoughts on the\\nannual event.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n**Why should individuals and organisations in the cloud industry be excited to\\nattend CloudStack Collab 2023?**\\n\\n*\u201cI think the conference gives a great opportunity to everyone in the community,\\nbe it an individual, a small and midsize business, or an enterprise, to\\nparticipate, collaborate, learn about what is coming in CloudStack and to meet\\nand network with people.*\\n\\n*CloudStack Conferences and events provide a neutral space for the community to\\ncome together, interact and learn about ongoing and future development of the\\nproject, influence the direction of the project and form potential partnership\\nwith one-another to support their objectives. This can also ensure long-term\\nstability of the contributor base, participation and health of the project.*\\n\\n*The benefit of a hybrid event is those who aren\'t able to attend the conference\\nin person can still participate online, and watch the video streams or the\\nrecordings later on.*\\n\\n*It can also benefit people looking to learn about reducing cloud costs. It is\\nnot a new thing that companies around the world are under financial pressure. We\\nhave seen through various scenarios in the past, that moving from VMware to\\nCloudStack, or moving away from Hyperscalers to CloudStack can significantly\\nreduce the cost of ownership. So, the conference and its videos can help a lot\\nof people who are considering CloudStack, as well as those already implementing\\nit.\u201d*\\n\\n**Are there any specific talks that stand out to you and that you are most looking forward to?**\\n\\n*\u201cThere are certainly several talks that I am really excited about \u2013 these are new\\nfeatures in Apache CloudStack, use-cases of CloudStack, as well as sessions from\\nthought leaders who are going to talk about their perspective on CloudStack and\\nopen-source. So, I am particularly excited about these talks.\u201d*\\n\\n**Can you give a sneak peek into your \u2018State of the Union\u2019 talk?**\\n\\n*\u201cOne of the things I did was look at what previous VPs spoke about in their\\nState of the Union talks. So, there will be content about the community, changes\\nsince last years, updates about releases and reflecting on what happened in the\\ncommunity, in the last year.*\\n\\n*I will also look into trends in the community, whether that is from the mailing\\nlists or from GitHub, as well as discuss new initiatives in the community. I\'m\\nstill figuring out a theme to stitch the content that I already have and\\nI am reaching out to people and organisations for quotes in support of\\nCloudStack.\u201d*\\n\\n**How do you feel the CloudStack community has evolved in recent years?**\\n\\n*\u201cJust like the project itself, the community has matured a lot alongside it. We\\nhave over a decade of CloudStack releases, making it a stable and mature\\nproduct. A lot of people have been with the project since the early days and\\nthey have a stable and mature outlook on using CloudStack*\\n\\n*A term that can be applied here is [mechanical\\nsympathy](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.mechanical-sympathy.en.html#:~:text=Mechanical%20sympathy%20is%20when%20you,Jackie%20Stewart%2C%20racing%20driver),\\nwhich can explain how and why some people can become more intuitive than others\\nwhen it comes to the open-source software. As a result, CloudStack becomes an\\nextension of somebody who understands it better, as they will know its\\nlimitations, thus meaning they know where to push it and where not to push it.\u201d*\\n\\n**How does the CloudStack Collaboration Conference contribute to fostering\\ncollaboration among the CloudStack community members?**\\n\\n*\u201cThere are a lot of users/vendors who have their idea of where CloudStack could\\nbe extended and used. One of the great perks of CCC is that it gives networking\\nopportunities, where people can discuss their ideas, roadmaps and align with\\nothers on where they want to see CloudStack go.*\\n\\n*We have seen in the past where multiple parties have come together to push\\nCloudStack in a direction with respect to a feature or their roadmap or business\\nstrategy.\u201d*\\n\\n**Do you believe that open-source technologies will become more prevalent\\namong MSP\u2019s and enterprises? If so, why? **\\n\\n*\u201cYes, I believe so. Any open-source project would have a community around it\\nand that it is easy to get access its the source code, modify and\\nredistribute it. What that unlocks is that for the same software, there might be\\nmultiple vendors, which means there is not a vendor lock-in and therefore the\\ntotal cost of ownership is lower.*\\n\\n*Open-source also fosters innovation, as every MSP or enterprise will have their\\nown roadmap and things they want to do with the software. Achieving these\\nobjectives will require changes in the software, which is possible because\\nthey\u2019re not dependent on a vendor, meaning they can do it themselves or they can\\npartner with other parties in the relevant open-source ecosystem to achieve their\\ngoals.\u201d*"},{"id":"ccc2023-agenda-revealed","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/ccc2023-agenda-revealed","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2023-10-03-ccc2023-agenda-revealed/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-03-ccc2023-agenda-revealed/index.md","title":"CloudStack Collaboration Conference Agenda is Now Live!","description":"Are you ready for the most anticipated Apache CloudStack event of the year?

After a year of success in which Simon\\nWeller chaired the project, we are now excited to welcome Rohit, who is a\\nlong-term contributor to the project. He has a strong technology background and\\nhas been engaged in the open-source world for more than a decade, during which\\nhe contributed to multiple other open-source projects.\\n\\nIn this interview, you will be able to learn more about Rohit Yadav and see his\\nperspective on the VP\'s role and how he can contribute to the Apache CloudStack\\nproject evolution.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n**Why do you believe in open-source, where and how did it all start?**\\n\\nDuring my university days, I got introduced to open-source as a way of\\ncommunity-driven development. Compared to proprietary and closed-source\\nsoftware, I found the idea of open-source remarkable that anybody can access\\nsource code, learn it, modify it, distribute it, and even contribute it back.\\n\\nIn my spare time, I started learning and contributing to a few open-source\\nprojects as a hobby and even created some open-source side-projects. I also got\\nan opportunity to work with the VideoLAN project as a Google Summer of Code\\nstudent and later worked as a volunteer summer student at CERN.\\n\\n![Rohit Yadav](small-photo.jpg \\"Rohit Yadav\\")\\n\\nAll of this early experience inculcated an interest in open-source and\\nvirtualisation, and eventually, I was hired straight out of university by Citrix\\nto work on open-source Apache CloudStack project that was still in the ASF\\nincubator at the time. This is when I learned about the ASF and how to work in\\nthe Apache CloudStack community from my colleagues and from the community, and I\\nlearnt how to [contribute changes](https://infra.apache.org/contributors.html).\\nI started lurking and interacting on the project [mailing lists](/mailing-lists)\\nand IRC to understand how to work in this community.\\n\\nI quickly found myself supporting users on the mailing lists and learning\\nreal-world use of CloudStack, contributing patches such as maintaining our (new)\\nmaven-based build system, working on some issues and making some improvements. I\\nalso wrote the [cloudmonkey\\nCLI](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey) because there wasn\u2019t one\\navailable and I also ended-up working on a large APIs refactoring project that\\nhelped me understand CloudStack deeper and work closely with the original\\ncreators and architects of CloudStack.\\n\\nDuring this, I was invited to become a committer to the project and got\\nsponsored to participate in the first CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2012\\nin Las Vegas. After another few years of working on flagship CloudStack\\nfeatures, frameworks, releases, maintaining CloudStack and collaborating with\\nthe community, I eventually got invited to become a PMC member.\\n\\nI\u2019ve transitioned into a more supporting, mentoring, empowering and leadership\\nrole in the community and at work. This allows me to find time and bandwidth to\\nchampion and promote Apache CloudStack in all forums and platforms.\\n\\n![Rohit Yadav](photo.jpg \\"Rohit Yadav\\")\\n\\n**Why should enterprises use open-source solutions?**\\n\\nEnterprises nowadays are adopting open-source software especially when it comes\\nto infrastructure software. This gives them business advantage in keeping low\\ncosts and not having to depend on a single vendor (no vendor lock-in) while have\\nthe longevity, trust, stability, reliability, durability, flexibility, better\\nagility and security, and access to an ecosystem of community and commercial\\nofferings and support around it. There is also community and inter-organisation\\ncollaborations on standards, frameworks and feature development that help reduce\\ncosts for the end-consumers, including the enterprises.\\n\\nEnterprises also attract better talent as it\u2019s generally much easy to hire or\\ntrain talent on open-source software with its documentation and other types of\\ntraining materials in the form of books, blogs and videos etc., accessible to\\neverybody.\\n\\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine any enterprise and any consumer product or service that\\nwon\u2019t have any open-source project used in their stacks.\\n\\n**Who are the existing enterprise users of Apache CloudStack and how are they benefiting?**\\n\\nAnybody looking to implement (private or public) IaaS cloud should seriously\\nconsider CloudStack. It is easy to-use, cost-effective, very stable, massively\\nscalable, highly reliable battle-tested IaaS cloud computing platform,\\nwell-known and used in production at many of the world\u2019s largest organisations.\\nThe project is community-driven by diverse contributors who are deeply invested\\nin solving real-world\\n[use-cases](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Case+Studies).\\n\\nYou don\u2019t have to take my word for it - as an open-source top-level\\n[ASF](https://apache.org/) project anybody can test drive and see it for\\nthemselves, there is no vendor lock-in or paywall to get started. It takes a\\nvery short amount of time and effort to set it up, perhaps a few hours or less\\nfor a seasoned administrator. We have the [quick install\\nguides](https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/latest/quickinstallationguide/qig.html)\\nfor anybody to get started and even a public simulator-based demo environment\\nfor anybody with a few minutes to try it out, get the look-and-feel for it at\\nhttps://qa.cloudstack.cloud/simulator/ (using the demo-environment credentials\\nadmin:password).\\n\\nCloudStack is very easy to deploy, use and manage. Being a monolith application,\\nit\u2019s easier to upgrade, can be managed by a small team. It is feature-rich, and\\noffers a great UI, APIs and rich tooling and libraries such as\\n[cloudmonkey](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey) (cmk, the\\nofficial CLI), the [CloudStack Terraform\\nprovider](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-terraform-provider), the\\n[CloudStack Kubernetes\\nprovider](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-kubernetes-provider), the\\n[CloudStack Cluster-API Provider](https://cluster-api-cloudstack.sigs.k8s.io/)\\n(CAPC), the [CloudStack Go-SDK](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-go),\\n[support for\\nAnsible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_cloudstack.html),\\nand countless other integration, libraries and related projects in its\\never-growing ecosystem.\\n\\nAs an open-source project, Apache CloudStack project does not track who uses it.\\nStill, we have a fair idea of our user base based on the community-maintained\\nand contributed [list of users](https://cloudstack.apache.org/users.html) on our\\nproject website. Also, based on activities and representation by such users and\\ntheir organisations in the community by their participation on the mailing\\nlists, around releases, issue reporting and code contributions on GitHub,\\nattendance and participation in project meetups and conferences, and other\\nforums such as blogs, videos, websites, press releases, social media etc. These\\nenterprises, organisations and users include some of the world\u2019s largest Fortune\\n500 companies.\\n\\nI get super motivated and content when I read CloudStack\\n[case-studies](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Case+Studies)\\nor when I learn where and how our work on CloudStack benefits the core mission\\nof companies. In the most recent CloudStack Collab conference, I was delighted\\nto learn how CloudStack [empowers the Digital India\\nmission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq2LVY18GU8) that helped [vaccinate\\nbillions](https://www.cowin.gov.in/) as well as delivers digital product and\\nservices to citizens.\\n\\n**How is Apache CloudStack project evolving and where do you see its future?**\\n\\nOver the years, we\u2019ve seen a steady stream of [developer\\ncontribution](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/graphs/contributors) and\\n[releases](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/releases). We\u2019re seeing\\nCloudStack getting more and more polished with every release. We\u2019ve grown into a\\npedigree of PMC members, committers, contributors and power users who have been\\naround in the community for a long time, a decade or more now. This demonstrates\\nthe reliability, durability and stability the project offers to the users\\ncommunity and the trust of the users community who are continuing to use and\\nsupport CloudStack over the years. We\u2019re seeing CloudStack adoption growing\\nsteadily from users participation on mailing lists, GitHub, meetups and\\nconferences and release adoption. Per the hype curve, we\u2019re in the plateau of\\nproductivity so this isn\u2019t surprising.\\n\\nWe have always been a community-driven project and that should continue. We may\\nalso see interesting integrations, features and other changes to align with the\\nchanging themes and trends of the industry and the users community, we may find\\nsuch use-cases in AI, data sovereignty, privacy and cloud-repatriation.\\n\\nWe need to ensure there\u2019s a healthy community that feels welcome to use\\nCloudStack, report issues, participate on the mailing lists and in meetups and\\nconferences, and tell us about their use-cases and problems in all such forums.\\n\\nThe users community should be supported to contribute to CloudStack, and [help\\ntrain](https://github.com/shapeblue/hackerbook) on CloudStack development, help\\ncontribute fixes, enhancements and feature that solves their problems, and\\ninvite them to become committers and PMC members of the project. As long we\\nsupport a healthy feedback loop and maintain the cycle of the project it will\\ncontinue to grow, evolve, and thrive. We also need more efforts towards project\\nmarketing and promotion, and some work on strategic features, frameworks and\\nintegrations that leads to more growth and adoption of CloudStack.\\n\\n**Start contributing!**\\n\\nWant to become a committer and join a great community?

In this Solution Brief, TF integrates with CloudStack as an SDN plugin to enable rich networking capabilities and lifecycle management of VMs and containers where TF components or control functions are deployed.</p>\\n<p>The deployment and life-cycle management of Tungsten Fabric can be done with tools like Ansible. After Tungsten Fabric and CloudStack are installed, we need to create a zone with the TF isolation method, and then, when we create a network or a vm in CloudStack, TF plugin will call the TF Controller API to create the resources.</p>\\n\\n<a class=\\"button button--primary button--lg\\" target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"/files/acs-tungsten-fabric-sdn.pdf\\"><b>DOWNLOAD THE SOLUTION BRIEF</b></a><br/><br/>\\n\\n<strong>Key Outcomes for Users</strong>\\n\\n<p>Apache CloudStack has long provided flexibility regarding network configuration to serve the needed use case. Along with built-in functionality, ACS has supported a number of different Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers, including VMware NSX multi-hypervisor (formally Nicara), Nuage and others.</p>\\n<p>However, Apache CloudStack lacked a fully-featured open-source SDN controller to deliver advanced networking features.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Apache CloudStack\'s integration with Tungsten Fabric will finally close this feature gap providing many long sought-after features, including BGP, MPLS, service stitching and deep security policy capabilities to meet even the most stringent industry requirements.</p>\\n<p>CloudStack will be able to manage these advanced functions via tight integration with the underlying best-of-breed network controller, while Tungsten Fabric handles the network fabric.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><span><strong>The Community Adopting the Integration of Apache CloudStack and Tungsten Fabric</strong></span></p>\\n<p>A number of community members have already adopted Tungsten Fabric as part of their cloud infrastructure. We reached out to the community to hear their thoughts on the integration and how it benefits their organisation.</p>\\n<p><em>&lsquo;&rsquo;The EWERK Group mainly serves organizations in system-relevant industries with regulated IT. In these industries, highly complex IT infrastructure projects place special demands on the network. In order to meet these requirements, a future-oriented further development with the highest demand on technological know-how and flexibility of the software is needed.

Now an in-place upgrade of CloudStack virtual routers can be performed with zero downtime.</span></span></span></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><span ><span ><strong><span >VR Live Patching</span></strong></span></span></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><span ><span ><span >Underpinning zero downtime upgrades is the new feature VR live patching. This feature can also be used independently of upgrades and allow CloudStack admins to apply software updates to Virtual Routers on the fly. Previously all Apache CloudStack scripts to manage the Virtual Router were stored in an ISO image and mounted during the first boot and then copied to the Virtual Router. Now the update is performed dynamically , as long as the base OS remains constant , users to not need to recreate the Virtual Router.</span></span></span></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><span ><strong><span ><span >IPv6 support for Isolated and VPC Networks</span></span></strong></span></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><span ><span ><span >IPv6 is considered a natural evolution of any system that intends to be present in computing environments in the future. The RIPE NCC, which assigns IP addresses in 76 countries to ISPs and other organizations, got its final allocation of IPv4 addresses from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in 2012.</span></span></span><br />\\n<span ><span ><span >Apache CloudStack already supported IPv6 for Shared Networks; now IPv6 is also supported for Isolated Networks and VPC. Users can deploy IPv6 networks where routing is currently static, allowing users to use subnets of IPv6 networks directly in CloudStack instances.</span><br />\\n<span >In this context, unlike IPv4 that relies on NAT to deliver network services to users, the Virtual Router behaves like a real router, routing IPv6 packets and allowing users to configure firewall.</span></span></span></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><span ><strong><span ><span >Self-service Network Improvements</span></span></strong></span></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><span ><span >Previously, the creation of Shared Networks and Private Gateways was an admin- only feature. When a user needed a Shared Network or Private Gateway, they would have to make a service request to the Service Provider or infrastructure operations team. Only after that, users could configure and use their respective resources.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span ><span >With Apache CloudStack 4.17, users can self-serve the creation of these resources through the UI or API with no involvement of the admin.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><strong><span ><span >To learn more about the remaining features introduced in the 4.17 release, read the </span><a href=\\"https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/what-s-new-in-apache1\\" ><span >release blog.</span></a></span></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n<p><strong><span ><u><span ><span >New CloudStack Integrations</span></span></u></span></strong></p>\\n\\n<p><span ><span >The community has collaborated on a new blog series named &lsquo;CloudStack Integrations&rsquo;, introducing a range of technologies with which CloudStack is integrated with and can become part of your technology stack.

Some exciting features you will be able to find in the new release are: </span></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><span ><span ><strong>Edge computing (4.18)&nbsp;</strong></span></span></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><span ><span >Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the data source and end consumer. The presence of computing capabilities at the edge of the network reduces response times for applications while reducing connectivity costs.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span ><span >This new feature will enable</span><span > operators to leverage CloudStack in deploying light-weight Zones in edge locations. Compared to the traditional CloudStack zones, a dehydrated zone results in resource savings on the boards - solving problems related to latency at low cost in regions poorly served by the internet network.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><span ><span ><strong>Tungsten SDN Fabric (4.18)</strong></span></span></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><span ><span >Tungsten Fabric is an open-source SDN project that solves tooling complexity with the simplicity of only one networking and security tool. It is maintained by The Linux Foundation and is designed to support any cloud anywhere.&nbsp; </span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span ><span >From 4.18, Apache CloudStack users can leverage Tungsten Fabric as a Network Provider in Isolated and VPC Networks, adding this widely adopted SDN fabric to fill feature gaps in CloudStack, enhancing security and capabilities.</span></span></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><span ><span ><strong>Autoscaling (4.18)</strong></span></span></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><span ><span >This feature is an Apache CloudStack native solution, different from other approaches that created vendor lock-in of closed source products. From Apache CloudStack 4.18, cloud users can configure Autoscale VM Groups to dynamically scale up and down the number of Instances when the defined trigger conditions are met. </span></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span ><span >&hellip; and a lot more new capabilities, which will enable cloud operators to achieve more and manage easier their virtualisation. </span></span></p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<p><span ><strong><u><span ><span >At the end of the year&hellip;</span></span></u></strong></span></p>\\n\\n<p><span >It was great to see another year of expansion of the Apache CloudStack community. We are happy to see new companies around the world adopting the technology and becoming involved in the community, whether it is through collaborations, development or keeping active on the mailing lists. In order for an open-source project to develop and be successful, people need to give back to the project - something that the Apache CloudStack community does extremely well. We are very grateful to the community&rsquo;s efforts and progression in the technology, so kudos to all involved!&nbsp; </span></p>\\n\\n<p><span >New use cases are being shared, such as <a href=\\"https://www.arsat.com.ar/\\" >ARSAT</a> covering their use cases regarding cloud services in Argentinian government entities and also sharing their mid-term roadmap strategy to include the private sector in Arsat&acute;s client portfolio. Another thing worth reflecting on is how companies who have been adopting Apache CloudStack long-term have managed to build reliable solutions and are using the technology continuously without looking for alternatives. The reason being because CloudStack is constantly expanding its supported integrations and technologies landscape, plus the amazing pace of development and new features released. Last but not least, we also see more vendors interested in both adopting CloudStack or building new solutions on top of it like <a href=\\"https://www.apiculus.com/\\" >Apiculus</a> and <a href=\\"https://www.stackbill.com/\\" >StackBill</a> for example. </span></p>\\n\\n<p><span >We would like to say a big thank you to everyone involved in the project and look forward to collaborating at the CloudStack European User Group in May!</span></p>"},{"id":"apache-cloudstack-lts-release-41720","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/apache-cloudstack-lts-release-41720","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2022-12-16-apache-cloudstack-lts-release-41720.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-16-apache-cloudstack-lts-release-41720.md","title":"Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.17.2.0","description":"Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.17.2.0","date":"2022-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 16, 2022","tags":[{"label":"announcement","permalink":"/blog/tags/announcement"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Rohit Yadav","title":"PMC Member","url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","imageURL":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud.png","key":"rohit"}],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.17.2.0","authors":["rohit"],"tags":["announcement"],"slug":"apache-cloudstack-lts-release-41720"},"prevItem":{"title":"Apache CloudStack Year in Review - 2022","permalink":"/blog/year-in-review-2022"},"nextItem":{"title":"Apache CloudStack Use Cases, Benefits and its Projected Future","permalink":"/blog/apache-cloudstack-use-cases-benefits"}},"content":"<a href=\\"/blog/apache-cloudstack-lts-release-41720\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/73240143-71f2-48f9-b80e-650df203613d\\" width=\\"100%\\" /></a>\\n\\n## Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.17.2.0\\n\\nThe Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the release of CloudStack 4.17.2.0.\\n\\nThe CloudStack 4.17.2.0 release is a maintenance release as part of its 4.17.x  LTS branch and contains more than 20 fixes since the CloudStack 4.17.1.0 release.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nCloudStack LTS branches are supported for 18 months and will receive updates for the first 12 months and only security updates in the last 6 months.\\n\\nApache CloudStack is an integrated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) software platform that allows users to build feature-rich public and private cloud environments.

One, as enterprises are bringing their workloads &lsquo;back&rsquo; to their premises, CloudStack is going to play a key role, as owning and managing a CloudStack setup is much more efficient (w.r.t. manpower, costs, complexity) than other orchestrators. Two, as the future is going closer and closer to the end user (Edge, Web3 etc.), the portability of CloudStack makes it an ideal candidate to embrace cloud-native and Edge-native technologies to deliver powerful orchestration capabilities nearer to the end users.&rdquo;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><span ><strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, </strong><a href=\\"https://www.shapeblue.com/\\"><strong>ShapeBlue</strong></a></span></p>\\n<p><strong>Giles is the CEO and founder of ShapeBlue.

Most organisations are using CloudStack to drive either public cloud implementation or to orchestrate internally within an enterprise. As ShapeBlue is the company that provides services around CloudStack, we see our role as representing those customers in the open-source project. Secondary to that, we do use CloudStack in our own internal CI/CD environment, but that is a relatively small scale compared to most people using CloudStack.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>&ldquo;Against other IaaS orchestration platforms, CloudStack has got two key advantages: A) Ease of deployment - whereas a lot of other platforms are incredibly complex to deploy. B) Reliability - CloudStack has been around for over a decade, it&rsquo;s very stable, it&rsquo;s very well-known, it&rsquo;s in production use at many of the world&rsquo;s largest organisations.&rdquo;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you?&nbsp;</strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>&ldquo;CloudStack&rsquo;s scope will remain tightly defined. CloudStack does not have aspirations to become a new block storage platform or to become a container orchestrator, it&rsquo;s highly defined at the level, which is the virtualised based orchestration layer. CloudStack will become increasingly reliable, increasingly easy to deploy, and effectively we hope will just become boring.&rdquo;</p>\\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\\n<p><span ><strong>Philipp Reisner, CEO, </strong><a href=\\"https://linbit.com/\\"><strong>LINBIT</strong></a></span></p>\\n<p><strong>Philipp Reisner is one of the founders and CEO of LINBIT.

It consists of two well-concerted components. LINSTOR and DRBD. Each of them also has its independent use cases, where it is deployed alone. In this presentation, the combination of these two is examined. They form the control plane and the data plane of the SDS. We will touch on: Performance, scalability, hyper-convergence (data-locality for high IO performance), resiliency through data replication (synchronous within a site, 2-way, 3-way, or more), snapshots, backup (to S3), encryption at rest, deduplication, compression, placement policies (regarding failure domains), management CLI and webGUI, monitoring interface, self-healing (restoring redundancy after device/node failure), the federation of multiple sites (async mirroring and repeatedly snapshot difference shipping), QoS control (noisy neighbors limitation) and of course: complete integration with CloudStack for KVM guests. It is Open Source software following the Unix philosophy. Each component solves one task, made for maximal re-usability. The solution leverages the Linux kernel, LVM and/or ZFS, and many Open Source software libraries. Building on these giant Open Source foundations, not only saves LINBIT from re-inventing the wheels, it also empowers your day 2 operation teams since they are already familiar with these technologies.</div>\\n\\n<a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEWjocVhzno&list=PLnIKk7GjgFlYcKNbhYSgWGbJ8nJ0g496V&index=22\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/3a720046-c093-4636-83bb-e48f4f64da92\\" alt=\\"Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 11.41.03.png\\" width=\\"750\\" height=\\"393\\" /></a>\\n\\n<iframe  src=\\"https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/a81uXODtt3KItT\\" width=\\"854\\" height=\\"712\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" marginwidth=\\"0\\" marginheight=\\"0\\" scrolling=\\"no\\" allowfullscreen=\\"allowfullscreen\\"><span data-mce-type=\\"bookmark\\"  class=\\"mce_SELRES_start\\">\ufeff</span> </iframe>\\n<div ><strong>About Phillip Reisner:</strong></div>\\n<div>Philipp Reisner is one of the founders and CEO of LINBIT in Vienna/Austria.

With the help of Stack Console\u2019s reseller management module and CloudStack, a data center or cloud service provider can build resellers/partners and provide them with an automated white-label cloud management platform so they can sell cloud services under their own brand, such as compute, Kubernetes, load balancer, block storage, and so on. Many of resellers are likely to be small and medium-sized businesses that want to get into the cloud market, so this is great news for them.

I subsequently completed my masters in software engineering and worked as a developer with different ISPs where my interest in infrastructure programming was kindled.</p>\\n<p><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong></p>\\n<p>My first exposure to CloudStack was in 2013 and since then I have embarked on a very exciting journey where I have evolved from a CloudStack user to an evangelist. I love tinkering on CloudStack and the techno-commercial possibilities it offers to the regional Internet, Cloud and Data Center providers.</p>\\n<p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong></p>\\n<p>I have received a lot of help from the community. If I must take a single name, it would be Rohit Yadav. He has been my mentor and will probably remain so for a while as far as CloudStack is concerned. During my initial days, folks from Citrix helped me a lot too, Vimmy Hong for one.</p>\\n<p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong></p>\\n<p>My commitment to CloudStack has been indirect but impacting. It has been taking it to the industry - the enterprises, telecoms, ISPs and data centre providers and showcasing how CloudStack can be leveraged as a viable cloud business model and implementing the same across various geographies. My organisation&rsquo;s product offering is completely architected by leveraging CloudStack and transforming it into a techno-commercial solution.</p>\\n<p>On the technical side, I have worked extensively on various aspects of monitoring CloudStack and shared the same amongst the community. I am currently looking to implement an outside-in way of monitoring VRs and providing auto-scale facilities without modifying the CloudStack code.</p>\\n<p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong></p>\\n<p>It&rsquo;s cost-effective, allows unmatched customising flexibility and it works! It&rsquo;s that simple. Since it&rsquo;s community-driven, it is always balanced. The collective intelligence of the community is always greater than the sum of each individual&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>\\n<p>Many pairs of eyes mean tighter, more secure, more relevant and more efficient code. Your choice to pay for support is completely de-linked from the licence to use the product. What&rsquo;s more, there are a plethora of licences to choose from to leverage the same in your own product/service offering.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>Follow him on Twitter:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\\"https://twitter.com/kbshivkumar\\" title=\\"https://twitter.com/kbshivkumar\\">https://twitter.com/kbshivkumar</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Connect with him on LinkedIn:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/kbshiv\\" title=\\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/kbshiv\\">https://in.linkedin.com/in/kbshiv</a>\\n</p>"},{"id":"advisory-apache-cloudstack-advisory-on","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/advisory-apache-cloudstack-advisory-on","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2022-06-17-advisory-apache-cloudstack-advisory-on.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-17-advisory-apache-cloudstack-advisory-on.md","title":"[ADVISORY] Apache CloudStack Advisory on KVM Shared Mount Point issues on version 4.17.0.0","description":"On 14th June 2022, a new issue affecting only KVM users using Shared Mount Point storage was reported [1].

This issue affects the creation and the usage of existing Shared Mount Point storage pools on Apache CloudStack 4.17.0.0.<br />\\n\\nApache CloudStack 4.17.0.0 added support for the StorPool storage based on Shared Mount Point. However, the current version of CloudStack doesn&#39;t allow multiple implementations of Shared Mount Point storage pool providers, causing the StorPool provider to override the default implementation. This affected the other storage pool providers for Shared Mount Point since CloudStack tries to add them as a StorPool storage pool.<br />\\n\\nTo mitigate the issue, a CloudStack administrator needs to do the following on version 4.17.0.0:<br />\\n- On each management server: stop the CloudStack management service, remove the Storpool plugin jar on /usr/share/cloudstack-management/lib/cloud-plugin-storage-volume-storpool-4.17.0.0.jar and restart the CloudStack management service<br />\\n- On each KVM host: stop the CloudStack agent service, remove the StorPool plugin jar on /usr/share/cloudstack-agent/lib/cloud-plugin-storage-volume-storpool-4.17.0.0.jar and restart the CloudStack agent service<br />\\n\\nNote: This workaround removes the StorPool plugin support. StorPool users should not apply the workaround to continue using their Storpool storage.<br />\\n\\nThis issue will be fixed in the upcoming CloudStack version 4.17.1.0.<br />\\n\\n[1]&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/6455\\" title=\\"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/6455\\">https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/6455</a></p>"},{"id":"apache-cloudstack-4-17-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/apache-cloudstack-4-17-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2022-06-07-apache-cloudstack-4-17-release.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-07-apache-cloudstack-4-17-release.md","title":"Apache CloudStack 4.17.0.0 LTS Release","description":"The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache&reg; CloudStack&reg; v4.17","date":"2022-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 7, 2022","tags":[{"label":"announcement","permalink":"/blog/tags/announcement"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ivet Petrova","title":"PMC Member","url":"https://github.com/IvetPM","imageURL":"https://github.com/IvetPM.png","key":"ivet"}],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Apache CloudStack 4.17.0.0 LTS Release","tags":["announcement"],"authors":["ivet"],"slug":"apache-cloudstack-4-17-release"},"prevItem":{"title":"[ADVISORY] Apache CloudStack Advisory on KVM Shared Mount Point issues on version 4.17.0.0","permalink":"/blog/advisory-apache-cloudstack-advisory-on"},"nextItem":{"title":"What\'s New in Apache CloudStack 4.17","permalink":"/blog/what-s-new-in-apache1"}},"content":"*The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache**&reg;** CloudStack**&reg;** v4.17*<br />\\n\\nApache CloudStack 4.17.0.0 is a 4.17 LTS release with 383 new features, improvements and bug fixes since 4.16, including 16 major new features.

CloudStack has always been easier to upgrade than many of its competitors but has required its virtual routers to be redeployed during an upgrade.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>o Zero Downtime Upgrades for Virtual Routers</strong><br />\\nWith this new feature, the virtual router does not have to go through the process of complete removal and instantiating a new one involving shutdown, resource release, system VM template copy from secondary storage to primary, starting and VR configuration<br />\\nPreviously when a new release of Apache CloudStack was deployed, the operations team had to organize maintenance windows to allow the redeployment of every virtual router. Now an in-place upgrade of CloudStack virtual routers can be performed with zero downtime.<br />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>o VR Live Patching</strong><br />\\nUnderpinning zero downtime upgrades is the new feature VR live patching. This feature can also be used independently of upgrades and allow CloudStack admins to apply software updates to Virtual Routers on the fly. Previously all Apache CloudStack scripts to manage the Virtual Router were stored in an ISO image and mounted during the first boot and then copied to the Virtual Router. Now the update is performed dynamically , as long as the base OS remains constant , users to not need to recreate the Virtual Router.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>IPv6 support for Isolated and VPC Networks</strong></p>\\n<a href=\\"/img/imported/919e55f8-b723-4680-b538-f9afc2ce0e01\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/919e55f8-b723-4680-b538-f9afc2ce0e01\\" alt=\\"2.png\\" width=\\"750\\" height=\\"393\\" /></a>\\n\\n<p>IPv6 is considered a natural evolution of any system that intends to be present in computing environments in the future. The RIPE NCC, which assigns IP addresses in 76 countries to ISPs and other organizations, got its final allocation of IPv4 addresses from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in 2012.<br />\\nApache CloudStack already supported IPv6 for Shared Networks; now IPv6 is also supported for Isolated Networks and VPC. Users can deploy IPv6 networks where routing is currently static, allowing users to use subnets of IPv6 networks directly in CloudStack instances.<br />\\nIn this context, unlike IPv4 that relies on NAT to deliver network services to users, the Virtual Router behaves like a real router, routing IPv6 packets and allowing users to configure firewall.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>StorPool Storage Plugin</strong></p>\\n<a href=\\"/img/imported/c15f95e5-3b77-4bc5-b518-dc42ca867041\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/c15f95e5-3b77-4bc5-b518-dc42ca867041\\" alt=\\"3.png\\" width=\\"710\\" height=\\"456\\"/></a>\\n\\n<p>StorPool is a software defined storage platform in use by many CloudStack operators globally. StorPool has had &ldquo;managed storage&rdquo; integration with CloudStack for some time but now the StorPool Storage plug-in is natively included with Apache CloudStack. Thanks to the built-in automation of the plug-in, cloud builders can seamlessly manage their cloud from CloudStack&rsquo;s familiar user interfaces, and all storage-related operations are transparently passed down to the underlying StorPool primary storage system.</p>\\n\\n<p>With the Storpool plug-in, the features available in StorPool get inherited by each cloud-deployed - enabling cloned provisioning, instant snapshots, thin provisioning, backup/DR and QoS policies per virtual disk and/or per Instance. Instance provisioning is nearly instantaneous and data placement policies and other settings can be changed in-flight to address changes in user requirements.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Self-service Network Improvements</strong></p>\\n\\n<a href=\\"/img/imported/417bd9d1-ba39-4904-b56b-bcf226dab4ff\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/417bd9d1-ba39-4904-b56b-bcf226dab4ff\\" alt=\\"4.png\\" width=\\"668\\" height=\\"575\\" /></a>\\n\\n<p>Previously, the creation of Shared Networks and Private Gateways was an admin- only feature. When a user needed a Shared Network or Private Gateway, they would have to make a service request to the Service Provider or infrastructure operations team. Only after that, users could configure and use their respective resources.</p>\\n\\n<p>With Apache CloudStack 4.17, users can self-serve the creation of these resources through the UI or API with no involvement of the admin.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Multi-account Network Access</strong></p>\\n\\n<a href=\\"/img/imported/6c540c73-9951-4cb7-8a4c-7fdf1b25a000\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/6c540c73-9951-4cb7-8a4c-7fdf1b25a000\\" alt=\\"5.png\\" width=\\"750\\" height=\\"242\\" /></a>\\n\\n<p>In Apache CloudStack, users are organized into a logical structure of Accounts and Domains. In previous version of Apache CloudStack, the resources of each Account weren&rsquo;t shared, and each Account had its own resources. As an example, sometimes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b a particular software application from a specific Account needed to access an application in another account under the same Domain. For this to be feasible, users configured their networks with the firewall rules, port forwarding, load balancing or private gateway to allow this type of use case. In addition, this configuration caused a lot of network overhead as all packets had to go through 2 different Virtual Routers to reach their destination.</p>\\n\\n<p>With Apache CloudStack 4.17, users can connect their instances by adding a new network interface from an Account under the same Domain, simplifying this kind of use case. Furthermore, if the communication between instances occurs only at OSI layer 2, several overheads are removed, considering that the I/O packets will be established between the instances directly in the same network layer to which they are connected.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Multiple SSH Keys</strong></p>\\n\\n<a href=\\"/img/imported/6242bd8e-d5ad-4027-aed4-3dd576a58199\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/6242bd8e-d5ad-4027-aed4-3dd576a58199\\" alt=\\"6.png\\" width=\\"750\\" height=\\"393\\" /></a>\\n\\n<p>CloudStack users can now create Instances and include multiple SSH Keys. This avoids the need to share private keys between users that access the Instance.</p>\\n\\n<p>Previously, if users needed to add more SSH Keys to access the instance, it was necessary to connect to the instance and then edit the .ssh/authorized_keys file, however now all the keys needed can be selected during the instance creation itself.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Structured System Events</strong></p>\\n\\n<a href=\\"/img/imported/69265134-a914-48d2-8af0-70cb5d8d0828\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/69265134-a914-48d2-8af0-70cb5d8d0828\\" alt=\\"Untitled design.png\\" width=\\"750\\" height=\\"647\\" /></a>\\n\\n<p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 brings much more structure to its system Events. Auditability and traceability of operations performed are important requirements for most organisations.</p>\\n\\n<p>CloudStack Events are the primary data-source for auditing and troubleshooting a CloudStack environment. Events have now been improved by being explicitly linking to the resource that the event concerns. This allows Events to be searched, filtered and sorted by object.</p>\\n\\n<p>Navigation is also improved, allowing users to navigate easily to the events for a specific object i.e. Instance, Network, Host</p>\\n\\n<p>Many CloudStack operators had previously parsed the Event messages to store them in a 3rd party data source. The messages remain unchanged to allow backwards compatibility of such integrations.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Snapshot improvements</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 introduces storage-based snapshots - an alternative for taking snapshots of virtual machines running under the KVM hypervisor. The current implementation uses libvirt to perform the snapshot and doesn&rsquo;t allow storage providers that keep VM virtual disks in RAW format (e.g., Ceph/NetApp SolidFire/LINSTOR/StorPool Storage) to take VM snapshots.</p>\\n\\n<p>The storage-based snapshots feature provides for such storage systems the functionality to take crash-consistent snapshots of any VM&rsquo;s virtual disks without the memory. The feature relies on each underlying storage plug-in&rsquo;s capability to create/revert/delete virtual disk snapshots.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Instance and Volumes migration improvements</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Apache CloudStack allows admins to migrate Instances and volumes using a wizard. Previously this wizard would automatically allocate Primary Storage for Instance Volumes based solely on storage tags. CloudStack 4.17 now allows the admin to explicitly allocate each Instance Volume to different specific Primary Storages.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition, to make more informed decisions while selecting destination host and storage, additional information is presented in the UI such as the occupancy of existing capacity of these resources, which brings a significant improvement in migration functionality.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>More flexible service offerings</strong></p>\\n\\n<a href=\\"/img/imported/7d34a18b-a0d9-4da5-8ffe-bfb66496aaf3\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/7d34a18b-a0d9-4da5-8ffe-bfb66496aaf3\\" alt=\\"9.png\\" width=\\"750\\" height=\\"596\\"/></a>\\n\\n<p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 redefines the relationship between the Service Offerings used for Instance Root Disks and the Service Offering for the Instance itself.</p>\\n\\n<p>Instance Root Volumes were previously handled decoupled from Disk Offerings: a change of the Root Volume characteristics wasn&rsquo;t possible due to this logical disconnection. Thus, users couldn&rsquo;t, for example, change to a Disk Offering that guaranteed higher I/O needs if necessary. So, there were two types of resources, Root volume and Data volume, but the treatment used in both was not unified.</p>\\n\\n<p>The existing model is still fully supported if required, but this improvement gives operators far greater flexibility when it comes to the provisioning and billing for root volumes.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Server Status Report</strong>\\nApache CloudStack 4.17 now gives admins the ability to see the status/health of their Management Servers, the Usage Server, and the underlying database server (and their respective individual components). This feature is available in the UI and API for integration/monitoring purposes.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>KVM multiple local storage</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 now supports multiple local storage volumes for KVM based Hosts. Previously, for KVM hosts, it was only possible to have one primary local storage, which prevented providers from adding extra disks to be offered on CloudStack.</p>\\n\\n<p>With this improvement, if more than one local disk on the KVM host is available, it is possible to designate them to be offered as a local disk offering , thus enabling a better use of allocated resources.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Reserve and release Public IPs</strong>\\nUsers can now reserve public IPs for later use on their networks. This new functionality makes managing this feature easier, as users often need to have IP information available beforehand to parameterize DNS records, for example.</p>"},{"id":"cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2022-november","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2022-november","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2022-05-26-cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2022-november.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-26-cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2022-november.md","title":"CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2022 - November 14-16","description":"For the 10th consecutive year, the Apache CloudStack community is organising its major event - CloudStack Collaboration Conference, running from 14th to 16th November 2022.

You can watch this <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sVYGehxsn0&amp;t=332s\\">here</a>. Below, you can find some of the key point&rsquo;s Simon laid out in the video.</p>\\n<p><strong>\u0422he </strong><strong>Evolution of Apache CloudStack: </strong><strong>Continue the community vision and drive forward</strong></p>\\n<p>&lsquo;I think that every project that gets accepted under the Apache umbrella always has to try and build that really important base of community, because without that community, you can\'t survive. We see a lot of projects that have got a lot of excitement and they just fade away. I think what\'s been really great about CloudStack over the years is that we\'ve managed to really continue that community vision and we\'ve got a really great core group of people that have been around a long time that still have that passion and want to encourage others to participate as well. But the most important thing of open source is, you have to get others to want to contribute and you have to get others to want to give up some of their time and effort in order to make sure that you don\'t just survive, but that you can actually drive forward a project into the future and make it sustainable.&rsquo;</p>\\n<p><strong>The Everyday Problems Open-source Solutions Solve: Building a Long-term sustainability</strong></p>\\n<p>&lsquo;Part of what I\'ve done since I started in technology has always been trying to leverage the best technology and the best open-source solutions that we can. But I think one thing that is often missed by a lot of enterprise environments and organisations is that they think that they can just take and just walk away. But the most important thing to sustainability long term is you have to be able to give back as well. So, part of what my mission has always been working at open source for a long time, is making sure that when we do talk to others and we encourage them to try the technology out and hopefully implement it into production, but also think about how are they going to give back long term so that the product and the project is sustainable.&rsquo;\\n</p>\\n<p><strong>The Secret of a Successful Open-source Community: Engagement in all areas</strong></p>\\n<p>&lsquo;I think it\'s a bit of a misnomer that a lot of people have that you have to be a developer in order to be able to give back to open-source. So, I\'m not a great developer, I dabble a little bit, but I\'m not going to claim that I\'m the best developer suited for any particular environmental project. Where I come in personally is I really try and give back to the user base from an engineering perspective. You\'ve got a problem -how do we help you fix it? You want to implement a potential way of doing things - how can we encourage others to collaborate on it together? So, I think that a lot of people need to get out of that mindset, that you\'ve got to be a coder in order to be able to give back to open source. There are so many other areas that you can contribute. I mean, case in point Ivet, you\'re fantastic at what you do, but you\'re not a developer, right? But you are encouraging others through your engagement practises, through organising events, through promoting the project overall to the community. And that is just as important, if not more so than ever writing a line of code. So I think that a lot of people need to start to maybe think about other areas that they can contribute outside of just writing a line of code, because a project doesn\'t survive long term unless you have that marketing capability, unless you have the outreach and you\'re able to encourage new participants because ultimately you\'re always going to have some people leaving the community and you need a long, robust pipeline of new members coming in to help out as well.&rsquo;</p>\\n<p><strong>Implementing CloudStack: Scalability, simplicity and reliability</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&lsquo;I think that what draws a lot of people to CloudStack is the fact that it supports a lot of different technologies. And a lot of companies at some point get to a realisation that they have to scale their environment. And doing that with a lot of the other products on the market with a commercial open source can be quite challenging. And case in point, we\'ve seen a lot of folks over the years that have started off with VMware or they might have started off with a public cloud solution like AWS or Azure or Google Cloud. They get to a point and then they figure out, well, how are we going to scale this? And let me explain what I mean by that, because a lot of people right now are saying, well, of course, you can scale AWS or Azure or Google Cloud, you can, but at a massive cost. So, scaling comes in to both how to make money long term if you\'re a commercial entity. And how to minimise those costs, how do you make it more manageable and how do you get to that next level? So, I think a lot of entities that start looking at that solution, such as Apache CloudStack, I think in not just about the pure technology play, but their thinking about the viability of the product long-term. Typically, what we see is that as new companies get started, or even established companies get started, they see a higher margin opportunity on the front end, and over time that starts to get a bit more commoditized. They\'re looking for areas of savings in the underlying technology, and I think that\'s where a lot of people start to look at CloudStack. I think also you see other people and other companies that have been at open-source for a long time. And they might have deployed KVM or some other hypervisor technology. And they just get to that technological point where they can no longer scale managing manually 100 hosts or something like that. And so, they start to look for orchestration methods to make their life easier. And that\'s really where CloudStack shines.&rsquo;</p>\\n<p><strong>The Benefits of Open-source Technology: Much more than cost-savings</strong></p>\\n<p>&lsquo;The number one thing that I always think about is flexibility. And the ability for you to take something that has already been built out and then add new capabilities to it, to meet the mission of your organisation\'s goals. For example, we\'ve contributed a lot of new features to CloudStack over the years that have been driven by customer demands. And that\'s the best way to build a business, as you build stuff that customers want to buy. So, I think by utilising open source in general or CloudStack or any open-source tooling, it allows you to take a great set of features and functionality that will scale and then add your own secret sauce to it. Or as we often do, give back that secret sauce to the community so they can get a benefit from it as well.&rsquo;</p>\\n<p><strong>Apache CloudStack: When and how it fits? </strong></p>\\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&lsquo;I\'d like to say that it can suit everyone, but I think that\'s probably not entirely true. I think that you have to have some level of expertise on your team in order to be able to support it long term. And that doesn\'t mean that you need to have a massive team. The fact that could be a team one, but it does take, as with any software platform in any project, it does take expertise in order to operate at long term. So, what I would say is, is that if you were thinking about deploying Apache CloudStack and you already have a few Linux chops under your belt, then that\'s probably more than enough for you to be able to explore and deploy. CloudStack is extraordinarily easy to deploy. We love to say that it just works. And that\'s a true statement. But if something starts to go south, if something starts to go wrong, you\'re going to have to start digging in a little better to the underpinnings of how the infrastructure works. Because you have to remember that CloudStack is effectively an orchestrator. It\'s managing other components. So those other components can go south, but CloudStack could be fine, right? So, it\'s important that you have a good understanding of how the ecosystem of various underpinnings of CloudStack functions so that you are more empowered to address problems if they do arise.&rsquo;</p>\\n<p><strong>The Path of Constant Improvement</strong><strong>: </strong><strong>From IaaS to building PaaS products on top of Apache CloudStack</strong></p>\\n<p>&lsquo;I think the community is always looking for new ways to improve. No software platform is perfect, right? If it is, then we could just go home, open a bottle of wine, and everything would be great. To be realistic about it, there&rsquo;s always new features. And the market is evolving at such a rapid pace these days that a lot of organisations are looking for new ways to be able to consume a service or consume a product. And I think that from CloudStack&rsquo;s perspective, we\'ve been very deliberate about where we plan, where we don\'t play. So, CloudStack has typically always been an infrastructure as a service orchestrator play. And there are other folks out there that are taking that as the underpinnings and building various platform as a service on top. So, I think there\'s always areas that we can improve and new features that we could add that are more underpinnings. But I think that one thing that we\'ve always done really good at as a community is knowing where we play and where we don\'t play, because in the end it\'s fine to contribute a massive new feature, but if no one\'s going to support it long term, then it\'s very difficult to get others to come in and number one, help out with that and to be able to promote it.&rsquo;</p><p><strong>Building a Stable Roadmap Inside an Open-source Community</strong></p>\\n<p>&lsquo;It often depends on open source of how the oversight is run. So, in some open-source projects, someone has decided that they want to open source and software and they put it up on GitHub and they are effectively God. They can do whatever they want. Whether other people support them or not is effectively irrelevant in that picture. But when you\'ve got a large product or service that is inside a more structured entity such as Apache, we have a lot of guidance on how a community should interact. And I think honestly, that is very healthy because we really want others to contribute ideas. We need to have a robust discussion around things. And sometimes that robust discussion can be a bit difficult for certain people. But it is it is crucial that we get by from the community in order to chart the right path. So, I wouldn\'t say it\'s a typical product management style roadmap that we see in open source, but it is very important that as ideas are brought to the table, they are discussed and that others are willing to support the overall vision so that we do go in the right direction. I think the other component too and we see this quite a lot in CloudStack is, we have commercial entities out there that are providing support and development services. Good examples of that is ShapeBlue and CloudOps and others. And they have customers that might say, you know what? We want you to develop this new feature for CloudStack, and then they agree to open source it and give it back to the community. So that\'s also a great way to continue to feature development because those features are often very commercially driven. And considering we are obviously predominantly used by those that commercially driven, those features can be easy to adopt by others as well.&rsquo;</p>\\n<p><strong>Release Management: Rapid Development of New Features and Capabilities</strong></p>\\n<p>&lsquo;We try and keep the release cadence pretty consistent overall. We have major releases and we have minor dot releases that are really focussed very much on critical bug fixes because in the end, the operator\'s utilising CloudStack expect stability. And so, we have to be quite deliberate about what we will allow and what we won\'t allow. So typically, when we\'re talking about a major release such as 4.16 or the future for 4.17, we are talking about new features that could be breaking changes. Potentially, we\'ll have high risk associated with them. If we\'re talking about 4.16.1, then we\'re talking about very, very minor changes that are totally focussed on stability and bug fixes. In terms of how we decide what features are going to new major release milestones, that\'s really got a lot to do with what has been reviewed and what the overall community is comfortable with. So, if an organisation or a developer brings in a new feature, they will open a pull request and they will request that to be merged and they will request review of that pull request via members of the community. And the members of the community will then make suggestions, or they might say, you know what, this is a cool feature, but we think it might break something else. And so, we would work with that contributor to figure out maybe how to re-implement that. But a very important part of CloudStack is stability. So, we always smoke test all of the new features that come in because we want to make sure that we are providing that long term stability that our users expect.&rsquo;</p><p><strong>Becoming Part of Apache CloudStack: An advice for developers</strong></p>\\n<p>&lsquo;CloudStack is a huge project. I mean, the amount of code at times is a bit mind boggling. And I think the number one thing that I would recommend to someone who wants to get into development is become part of the mailing lists. You know, we have great development mailing lists, we have great user mailing lists and get a test environment set up, start to play with it, start to understand the features, how the features work in your environment, and then start to explore the code. And don\'t be scared of asking questions. You know, we have a great group of people who are really, really willing to help. And I, for one, want to make sure that anyone who comes to the community is going to get a benefit of being able to hopefully avoid the pain and suffering that some of us have gone through trying to figure out how certain things work. If you&rsquo;re trying to implement something in a particular driver, I guarantee there&rsquo;s someone that has already suffered that pain before. So just asking on the mailing list, we can find that right person for you and they can hopefully help shortcut that learning curve. And the events are fantastic. During the COVID era which has obviously been challenging for all of us, we have had some of our biggest online events. Ivet you have produced and made them super successful which is fantastic. And so, it&rsquo;s just great seeing all these new people come out of the woodwork who are willing to learn and willing to become part of the community.&rsquo;</p>\\n<p><strong>The Targets of the VP: Simon&rsquo;s vision for the CloudStack development</strong></p>\\n<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m very lucky that the PMC&rsquo;s voted for me to be in this role and I just want to thank them for the support. Really, I just am going to be continuing on from the trailblazing people before me. We&rsquo;ve had a great group of others that have been in the VP position over the last decade. And I think the number one thing that every single person in this role wants, is to help drive forward the vision in the community around Apache CloudStack. So, that&rsquo;s really what I want to help do, I want to continue to talk to as many people as possible and hopefully encourage them to be part of the community so that we can continue to see the widescale success that we&rsquo;re known for. And I think part of getting out there and promoting the overall project is the desire to have more users. Because in the end we need that strong user base to not just survive, but to thrive. And there&rsquo;s always going to be a new use case that someone figures out. I think what we are starting to see more and more in the enterprise community right now is that public cloud is always going to be there. And I think that as some larger enterprises start to look at their costs associated with that, their starting to look a little bit more wider field of what the other options might be. So, we&rsquo;re seeing more and more companies saying, well look I know we said we weren&rsquo;t going to go and rent co-locations space again and put in servers and run our own cloud. But we should really run the numbers and figure out what they would look like&rsquo;</p>\\n<p><strong>CloudStack in 3 words</strong></p>\\n<p>&lsquo;It just works&rsquo;</p>"},{"id":"cloudstack-advisory-on-spring4shell-cve","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/cloudstack-advisory-on-spring4shell-cve","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2022-04-14-cloudstack-advisory-on-spring4shell-cve.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-14-cloudstack-advisory-on-spring4shell-cve.md","title":"CloudStack Advisory on Spring4Shell (CVE-2022-22965&nbsp;and&nbsp;CVE-2022-22963)","description":"At the beginning of April 2022, vulnerabilities in the Spring Framework for Java were publicly revealed.

Join the official event opening to learn more about the upcoming sessions, speakers and networking events. Discover also the latest news from the CloudStack Community!</p>\\n<p><strong>09:45- 10:30 - CloudStack with Ansible,&nbsp;</strong>Rene Moser</p>\\n<p>This call involves a brief introduction about how it all began and how the project stands today including a real-world example of how Ngine.io have managed workloads with Ansible on Exoscale.</p>\\n<p><strong>10:40 - 11:25 - Leveraging CloudStack and Apiculus to Launch and Operate a Profitable Public Cloud Business, </strong>Sunando Bhattacharya, IndiQus</p>\\n<p>Learn more about the learnings of IndiQus Technologies from working with 20+ cloud operators across the globe. CloudStack has been powering numerous cloud providers globally for over a decade. In this talk, Sunando Bhattacharya, CEO of IndiQus, will be delving into the primary reasons why CSPs are preferring it over the OtherStack and how IndiQus is combining CloudStack with their platform Apiculus, to deliver a Cloud Business platform. He will also be sharing some user stories about how some of his company&rsquo;s customers revolutionized the cloud business in their respective countries, thereby busting some myths about the IaaS business.</p>\\n<p><strong>11:35 - 12:20 - Building a DR Solution with CloudStack, </strong>Venko Moyankov, StorPool</p>\\n<p>Building a Disaster Recovery solution with KVM is not trivial. In this talk, Venko Moyankov will present how CloudStack cloud management and StorPool Storage can be used to build a multi-datacentre cloud with Disaster Recovery capabilities.</p>\\n<p><strong>12:30 - 13:15 - VM Job Queues in CloudStack,&nbsp;</strong>Suresh Kumar Anaparti, Software Engineer, ShapeBlue</p>\\n<p>CloudStack allows various life cycle operations for a Virtual Machine (VM). It maintains queues internally, to sync and perform all these operations. This talk briefs about how job queues are maintained in CloudStack, to execute the VM operations, followed by a demo.</p>\\n<p><strong>13:25 - 13:55 - Security in Shared Networks with VMware NSX, </strong>Alireza Eskandari, Afranet</p>\\n<p>Shared networks security can be a serious concern if different untrusted tenants use it together. Alireza will discuss Afranet&rsquo;s solution for IP and DHCP spoofing for these networks on VMware environments which are managed by CloudStack.</p>\\n<p><strong>14:05 - 14:50 - Integrating CyberSecurity Active Measures into CloudStack Kubernetes Service, </strong>Jesus Escolar, Exelerys</p>\\n<p>There is a constant rise in Cloud Native adoption. Most companies are evaluating how to migrate to newer, flexible, and automated platforms. Cloud-Native provides the answer, as well as the complications. Cloud-Native solutions are building themselves alone across the business, but who\'s securing them? Jesus will discuss the evolution of infrastructure solutions to Cloud Native, how can they be secured on CloudStack, what opensource security options are available today for CloudStack and where the future is leading towards Cloud Native security for CloudStack.</p>\\n<p><strong>15:00 - 15:30 - Boosting I/O Performance with KVM io_uring, </strong>Wido den Hollander, CLDIN B.V.<u></u></p>\\n<p>Storage performance is becoming much more important. KVM io_uring attempts to bring the I/O performance of a virtual machine to almost the same level as bare metal. Apache CloudStack has support for io_uring since version 4.16. Wido will show the difference in performance io_uring brings to the table.</p>\\n<p><strong>15:40 - 16:10 - Backup and Restore VMs based on KVM, </strong>Quentin Roccia &amp; Joffrey Luangsaysana, Dimsi</p>\\n<p>Dimsi has developed a backup solution for Virtual Machines based on KVM hypervisors. Every layer of the product uses Open Source libraries or components (Python, VueJS, Celery, Borg Backup, Redis, Socketio, Flask). There is no agent needed on the VMs. Dimsi has implemented a feature to group the hosts based on their use (CloudStack Hosts or Management Hosts) and apply specific policies to the groups. In the CloudStack context, this product can help you backup and restore all your VMs easily if the hypervisors are KVM-based. Moreover, restoring the VMs is effortless because KVM and CloudStack use the same id for the VM disks, so no need to hack the database to match them.</p>\\n<p><strong>16:20 - 17:05 - A Kubernetes CAPI Provider for Apache CloudStack, </strong>Peter (Motyka) Motykowski, Sr. Software Development Manager - Customer Engineering at Amazon Web Services (AWS)</p>\\n<p>Discover the new Kubernetes CAPI (Cluster-API) provider for Apache CloudStack \\"CAPC\\", enabling you to manage a range of Kubernetes clusters across Apache CloudStack and other supported infrastructure providers!CAPI is a Kubernetes sub-project focused on providing declarative APIs and tooling to simplify provisioning, upgrading, and operating multiple Kubernetes clusters. Started by the Kubernetes SIG (Special Interest Group) Cluster Lifecycle, the CAPI project uses Kubernetes-style APIs and patterns to automate cluster lifecycle management for platform operators. CAPI relies on infrastructure providers to provision the underlying infrastructure components.<br />In this talk, you will find out more about the newly developed provider, its capabilities, and how you can benefit from it!</p>\\n<p><strong>17:15 - 17:45 - Expose Router VM Statistics to Customers, </strong>Sina Kashipazha, Leaseweb</p>\\n<p>In recent years, some of Leaseweb&rsquo;s customers complained about the router VM resource usage and its availability. This made the company think that it would be nice to expose router VM statistics to the customers using the Prometheus format. In that way, they can set up their monitoring system and have more visibility over their network. Although it is still under development, Leaseweb thought it would be nice to discuss the project with the community members and gather feedback.</p>\\n<p><strong>17:45 - 19:00 - Networking and Beers</strong></p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><a href=\\"https://events.hubilo.com/cloudstack-european-user-group/register\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><strong>REGISTER NOW</strong></a></p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><strong>LEARN MORE ABOUT THE SPEAKERS:</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Giles Sirett</strong></p>\\n<p>Giles is a committer, PMC member of the Apache CloudStack project and Chairman of the European CloudStack User Group.

He spends his time designing and implementing features in&nbsp; CloudStack and can be seen acting as a release manager also.</p>\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<p><strong>Introduce yourself with a few words?</strong></p>\\n<p>My name is Nicolas Vazquez, and I am a software engineer. I am 31 years old, based in Uruguay and work as a Senior Software Engineer at Shapeblue. I\'m happily married and also a father of a young girl. I am a fan of sports, enjoy playing tennis and football. I also enjoy reading and listening to economic and political materials.</p>\\n<p><strong>Tell us your story in one Tweet?</strong></p>\\n<p>I have a degree in Computer Science and have worked on software development for the last 9 years. For the first years, I have worked mostly as a Java developer and since I met CloudStack I have been learning more about networking, storage, virtualisation. I became a CloudStack Committer in 2016 and a PMC member last year.</p>\\n<p><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong></p>\\n<p>I have met CloudStack in 2015 while I was working for my previous job. I personally didn\'t know about CloudStack but got assigned to a development project for it and that is where I started investigating and learning about it. I have been actively contributing and learning a lot since then.</p>\\n<p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong></p>\\n<p>My first mentor was Sergey Levitskiy. After I have joined Shapeblue, my mentor has been Rohit Yadav. I admire and appreciate both of them. I also enjoy acting as a mentor, recently have been assisting other community members - Suresh on the Release Management of the 4.16.1.0 release - which was released earlier this month.</p>\\n<p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong></p>\\n<p>My last commitment to CloudStack was acting as the Release Manager for the version 4.16.0 and also for the upcoming 4.17.0 version. Version 4.16.0 was released in November 2021 and introduces many interesting new features and improvements.</p>\\n<p>I am currently contributing by being the Release Manager for the upcoming 4.17 release of CloudStack. It is expected to bring a bunch of enhancements and new capabilities, such as improvements in the IPv6 support, shared networks, UX improvements for VM and volume migration and a lot more.</p>\\n<p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong></p>\\n<p>I think the power of open-source technologies is that these solutions are not bound to any company and are the result of many individuals from different companies interacting and cooperating to build the best possible product. This is beneficial for the users as the product can be extended by anyone and contributed back to the whole community. Last but not least, the support of the community is also very important, and in my opinion, CloudStack is an excellent example of a successful open-source project.</p>\\n<p><strong>Learn more about Nicolas:</strong> <a href=\\"https://github.com/nvazquez\\" target=\\"_blank\\">https://github.com/nvazquez</a></p>\\n<p><strong>Follow him on Twitter: </strong><a href=\\"https://twitter.com/nvazquezuy\\" target=\\"_blank\\">https://twitter.com/nvazquezuy</a></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"cloudstack-advisory-on-insecure-project","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/cloudstack-advisory-on-insecure-project","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2022-03-16-cloudstack-advisory-on-insecure-project.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-16-cloudstack-advisory-on-insecure-project.md","title":"CloudStack Advisory on Insecure Project Invitation Token (CVE-2022-26779)","description":"Apache CloudStack prior to 4.16.1.0 used insecure random number generation for project invitation tokens.

She is part of the CloudStack community for the last 3 years and is excited to work on new features and capabilities to improve the open-source cloud management solution.</p>\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<p><strong>Introduce yourself with a few words?</strong><br />Hi, I am Slavka Peleva and I work at StorPool Storage as a software developer. I have a Bachelor\'s Degree in Automation, information and control systems. I am a mother of a teenage boy. I love to read fantasy books, snowboarding in winters and rollerblading in summers.</p>\\n<p><strong>Tell us your story in one Tweet.</strong><br />I have always loved puzzles and brain teasers. For me, programming is an art. I have a passion for debugging and digging into the code.</p>\\n<p><br /><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong><br />In the middle of 2019 I have started to work at StorPool Storage. Then I did my first steps into CloudStack and it was my first open-source project. Since then I learned a lot and I met interesting people.</p>\\n<p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong><br />My colleagues at StorPool. I \u0430m very happy that I have the chance to work with such exceptional professionals. Thanks to them the beginning was not so hard. I should also thank Rohit Yadav and ShapeBlue who shared with me the hackerbook. When I felt a bit comfortable in the community I have started to bother most of the guys :) I am glad that the people in CloudStack\'s community are really supportive and nice and they have helped me in my journey.</p>\\n<p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong><br />Most of my contributing PRs are related to fixes with storage issues. One of the features that I have developed in CloudStack still did not get in but I hope that happens in the next release. It is for storage-based VM snapshots on KVM. Libvirt does not give the option to take virtual machine snapshots on images with RAW format. With this feature, the storage will have the functionality to take group consistent snapshots on all volumes of a virtual machine.</p>\\n<p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong><br />The biggest advantage is the quality. A lot of developers are actively going through the code and making changes and only the best changes get into the final version. The contributions that every one of us does is what makes CloudStack such a powerful technology that so many system administrators and solutions architects use to build up their clouds.</p>\\n<p><strong>Learn more about Slavka:</strong> <a href=\\"https://github.com/slavkap\\">https://github.com/slavkap</a></p>"},{"id":"apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release3","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release3","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2022-03-07-apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release3.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-07-apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release3.md","title":"Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.16.1.0","description":"The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the release of CloudStack 4.16.1.0.","date":"2022-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 7, 2022","tags":[{"label":"announcement","permalink":"/blog/tags/announcement"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ivet Petrova","title":"PMC Member","url":"https://github.com/IvetPM","imageURL":"https://github.com/IvetPM.png","key":"ivet"}],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.16.1.0","tags":["announcement"],"authors":["ivet"],"slug":"apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release3"},"prevItem":{"title":"Meet the Community - Slavka Peleva","permalink":"/blog/meet-the-community-slavka-peleva"},"nextItem":{"title":"Apache CloudStack Terraform Provider v0.4.0 Release","permalink":"/blog/apache-cloudstack-terraform-provider-v0"}},"content":"<a href=\\"/blog/apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release3\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/24029aa4-71d0-42df-880d-a6eb10610b80\\" alt=\\"cs-4161.jpg\\" width=\\"750\\" height=\\"393\\" /></a>\\n\\nThe Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the release of CloudStack 4.16.1.0.\\nThe CloudStack 4.16.1.0 release is a maintenance release as part of its 4.16.x LTS branch and contains more than 150 fixes and improvements since the CloudStack 4.16.0.0 release.

Container-based cloud-native applications promise to deliver computing power independent of the cloud provider or hardware platform and is the biggest trend registered widely by users and the market, as there are changes in cultural and technological paradigms.</p>\\n<p>In terms of cloud management systems used to orchestrate Cloud/IaaS environments, the main goal for companies in 2022 is decreasing operational effort and thus costs. Providers will be looking for platforms that can increase their competitiveness and deliver predictable results while eliminating licensing and vendor lock-in.</p>\\n<p>Apache CloudStack follows the technology wave and responds to the user demand for innovation and improvement. As part of this strategy, it is integrating Kubernetes and extending IPv6 support in the latest versions. Huge progress has been made in the installation and upgrade processes, making Apache CloudStack even easier to maintain and operate.</p>\\n<p><br /><strong>In this article, we will echo the voice of our community and wait for 2022 to pass to see which of the following predictions will become mainstream.</strong></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>Adoption of Open-source Technologies Will Continue to Grow</h2>\\n<p>Building an open-source environment with Apache CloudStack is a future-proof strategy for many Cloud / IaaS providers. A lot of enterprises now have the challenge of consolidating different environments under the hood of a single orchestration platform while ensuring minimal downtime of production environments. The CloudStack community believes that open-source, lightweight technologies like Apache CloudStack will be adopted more and more by companies who want to achieve simplicity, improve performance and scale instantly when needed.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>- <strong>Wido den Hollander, CEO/CTO at <a href=\\"https://www.tws.eu/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">CLouDINfra</a>:</strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;My challenges for 2022 are migrating and adopting legacy infrastructure into our Cloud(Stack) environment. While keeping customer services up and running we want to achieve these goals. Having everything central in a single cloud management platform gives me better insight on our performance, capacity and expansion needs.&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p>- <strong>Boyan Ivanov, CEO, <a href=\\"https://storpool.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">StorPool:</a></strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;The commoditization of IT started with the adoption of commodity hardware and open-source technologies like Linux &amp; KVM in hyperscalers. It is increasingly pervasive and leading to the commoditizing of the storage industry. We are seeing the emergence of Software-Defined Storage and Software-Defined Networking (among many other things), which have now become the default technologies to use in greenfield projects or refresh scenarios.&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p><em>- </em><strong>Sven Vogel, Senior Manager R&amp;D - Cloud and Infrastructure, <a href=\\"https://www.ewerk.com/startseite\\" target=\\"_blank\\">EWERK:</a></strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em>Today, many infrastructure deployments are using open-source technology as a key component.&nbsp; Through 2025, more than 70% of enterprises will increase their IT spending on open-source software, compared with their current IT spending, and by 2025, 75% of application development teams will implement software composition analysis tools in their workflow, up from 40% today, in order to minimize the security and licensing risks associated with open-source software. Source: <a href=\\"https://www.gartner.com/doc/4004007\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Gartner, <strong>Hype Cycle for Open-Source Software, 2021</strong></a>. </em></p>\\n<p><em>I share this assumption but I would also like to point out that more and more open-source projects hardly get any support. Many commercial companies are using OSS but it&rsquo;s also important to understand that the industry needs to support the people who make the projects &nbsp;live.&rdquo; </em></p>\\n<p>- <strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, <a href=\\"https://www.shapeblue.com/\\">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em>Open-source is here to stay - there is no better software model for innovation and long-term sustainability. However, far too many companies do not have a solid strategy on open-source. They use open-source software but do not understand the open-source model and how to engage in that model. The recent Log4J vulnerability demonstrated this perfectly. I expect to see many organisations finally thinking about how to properly run open-source in their environments and recognising that they can&rsquo;t just install the software and forget&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>Kubernetes</h2>\\n<p>The approach to delivering microservices and containerized applications in recent years changed completely the way we design, develop, and run web applications. New principles enable developers to create cloud-native applications using Kubernetes which side-by-side with open-source, is a hot topic for most Apache CloudStack community members who share their visions.</p>\\n<p>- <a href=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-beims-brascher/\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><strong>Gabriel Beims Br&auml;scher, VP Apache CloudStack</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;We already see significant growth in deployed containerized workloads and there is no reason to believe in 2022 it won\'t be a big deal. CloudStack also has been moving towards providing Kubernetes containers. This could trigger providers to start planning their move towards \\"containers as a service\\" as well.&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p>- <strong>Rohit Yadav, Principal Engineer, <a href=\\"https://www.shapeblue.com/\\">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;Kubernetes managed container-based workloads are becoming the new norm, and multi-arch container builds (same apps built as containers that can run on both x86, aarch64 etc. architectures) becoming easily available for most apps/software/packages will make this change and migration easier. For the end-users/developers at large, it doesn\'t / won\'t matter what tech/arch their workloads are running on.&rdquo; </em></p>\\n<p>- <strong>Kshitish Purohit, Chief Product Officer, <a href=\\"https://www.apiculus.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">IndiQus Technologies</a>:</strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;Kubernetes and cloud-native infrastructure will slowly start edging out virtualisation and traditional orchestration. And as this demand for cloud-native infrastructure grows, the older \'enterprise\' mindset will need to make way for decentralisation and autonomy.&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p>- <strong>Ezequiel McGovern - <a href=\\"https://www.arsat.com.ar/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">ARSAT</a>:</strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;The new software solutions are implemented on container technology. With scaling, shared storage and high availability, we believe that this will lead to more common use of local hypervisor storage, allowing multizone solutions to be deployed without the need for the Cloud manager to perform additional tasks.&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>COVID Impact on Cloud / IaaS providers</h2>\\n<p>Since the beginning of the COVID pandemic, we have seen a real impact in terms of life and workstyle. Inevitably two industries have developed the most during the pandemic - healthcare and IT. With the growing demand for XaaS,</p>\\n<p>- <strong>Rohit Yadav, Principal Engineer, <a href=\\"https://www.shapeblue.com/\\">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;Due to covid, WFH and remote working have become the new norm, and are here for the long term. This means demand for everything to support this life (work) style will continue to grow, with an increased need for Data Centre and cloud resources. Providers in telecom, data centre, and cloud space will continue to cater to this growing demand.&rdquo; </em></p>\\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\\n<h2><em>&nbsp;A</em>RM Platform</h2>\\n<p>Recently, Apple introduced the ARM M1 processor as a replacement for Intel in its products, and KVM and VMware already support virtualization based on ARM processors. What&rsquo;s next? Take a look at our predictions:</p>\\n<p>- <strong>Rohit Yadav, Principal Engineer, <a href=\\"https://www.shapeblue.com/\\">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;On the consumer front, most mobile and IoT devices are already ARM-based. Apple are leading the charge with their Mx series chips-based laptops and computers, and I think other manufacturers will follow (I think AMD should certainly consider grabbing this early market). We should see more ARM-based laptops in the next 5-10 yrs. More of these consumer devices means more developers will start using ARM-based computers to create apps, services, etc. that run on ARM and generate a requirement for more ARM-based servers/cloud providers. The strategy that will lead change is to build the ecosystem which is appearing to be working; a good business/developer benefit is that you\'ll write apps that will then run on mobile, IoT, laptop/consumer computers, and also in the cloud.&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>Edge Computing, Blockchain and Green Cloud</h2>\\n<p>The world\'s data is expected to grow 61% to 175 zettabytes by 2025. According to Gartner, around 10% of enterprise-generated data is created and processed outside a traditional centralized data center or cloud. By 2025, Gartner predicts that this figure will reach 75%. The increase of IoT devices at the edge of the network is producing a massive amount of data - storing and using all that data in cloud data centers pushes network bandwidth requirements to the limit.</p>\\n<p>- <strong>Kshitish Purohit, Chief Product Officer, <a href=\\"https://www.apiculus.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">IndiQus Technologies</a>:</strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;Web3 is already here and 2022 is going to see a lot of movement happening in this space. The \'decentralised tech\' landscape will find firmer ground as more understanding is built on the use of blockchains, edge and the likes. 2021 already saw this potential with big companies (and even governments) adopting these new technologies - crypto, AI, AR, metaverse etc. - and these are going to continue on an upward trend.&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p>- <a href=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-beims-brascher/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\"><strong>Gabriel Beims Br&auml;scher, VP Apache CloudStack</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;We are still far from ideal \\"green\\" data centres, but this has become relevant in the past years. An example of the relevancy of this subject can be seen at the European Commission\'s <a href=\\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/green-cloud\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><strong>Green cloud and green data centres</strong></a> policy. Additionally, studies show that moving companies\' internal workloads to <a href=\\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/09/23/how-cloud-migration-and-ai-can-help-reduce-carbon-footprint/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Cloud providers can reduce the CO2 footprint</a>. In 2022 we might see more ideas and proposals on how to improve efficiency, reducing energy costs and CO2 footprint. It is still hard to apply academic studies to the industry, but 2022 might be a year where we start changing it.&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>IPv6 Stack</h2>\\n<p>The continued expansion of the internet relies on a greater number of IP addresses, and with the current limitation of the IPv4 stack, it is impossible to continue this expansion. The advent of cloud-native applications based on containerized microservices requires a relatively large number of public addresses, so the use of 128-bit IPv6 stacks that, theoretically allowing IP addresses, allows for continued expansion.</p>\\n<p>- <a href=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-beims-brascher/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\"><strong>Gabriel Beims Br&auml;scher, VP Apache CloudStack</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;It is not news, IPv4 is reaching its limit. And each year we see companies and services being moved towards IPv6. This includes recent movements in Kubernetes 1.23 where Dual-stack IPv4 / IPv6 Networking has reached general availability (GA), in the last quarter of 2021.&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>Market Dynamics</h2>\\n<p>- <strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, <a href=\\"https://www.shapeblue.com/\\">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;</em><em>The meteoritic growth in the IaaS market is well documented and predicted by most analysts to continue strongly through 2022. There are lots of different numbers flying around but most of the analysts seem to settle on a c.30% YoY growth for IaaS - taking it to near 100 billion markets in 2022.&nbsp; Interestingly, the market share for the hyperscalers remains constant at about 80% - as much as most service providers would love to have some of that 80%, that still leaves a 20 billion growth market for everybody else.&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p>- <strong>Ezequiel McGovern - <a href=\\"https://www.arsat.com.ar/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">ARSAT</a>:</strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;The concept of buying VMs will gradually change to buying Docker clusters (K8S) or similar solutions, so cloud managers have to prepare to provide services that are further away from the hypervisor.&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>Private Cloud No More</h2>\\n<p>The private or on-premise cloud allows a company to run workloads in their private data center. It is increasingly common to see companies migrating their workloads to cloud providers, thus reducing CAPEX-related costs. See the prediction on this topic below.</p>\\n<p>- <strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, <a href=\\"https://www.shapeblue.com/\\">ShapeBlue:</a></strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;For a decade, the term private cloud has been used to describe a set of orchestrated/automated infrastructure components to give users a &ldquo;cloud-like&rdquo; experience of their own internal infra. Increasingly, environments such as this are being used as the foundation for automation - they become part of the plumbing instead of the end goal itself. I&rsquo;d therefore predict the term private-cloud starting to disappear from our lexicon.&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>Hybrid Cloud</h2>\\n<p>The use of multiple clouds, public and on-premise, allows operators to run applications based on containers in geographically dispersed locations of different providers, thus increasing the high availability of the applications and reducing the latency since, depending on the architecture, it allows operators to distribute the workloads to the cloud closest to the users using IP geolocation as well as edge clouds.</p>\\n<p>- <strong>Boyan Ivanov, CEO, <a href=\\"https://storpool.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">StorPool:</a></strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Hybrid capabilities become crucial going forward </strong>- <em>&ldquo;Due to mixed environments and new workloads, storage complexity is increasing, not decreasing. So agility, portability, and well-documented APIs are now prime considerations when designing cloud-native applications. These applications should run on-premises and off-premises in the same manner but on different hardware and software stacks. So agility, flexibility, versatility, integrations and APIs become key KPIs of a storage solution, along with performance (think latency, IOPS, GB/S) and TCO (think Total Cost of Ownership, $/GB)</em>.&rdquo;</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>Traditional SAN and Software-Defined-Storage</h2>\\n<p>On the storage market, the innovations and SDS will continue steadily to replace legacy technologies. It\'s a natural case of evolution. By using API-compatible devices, you can control granular details like IOPs, snapshots and scaling without any headaches. The natural evolution of storage is software-defined storage (SDS), decoupling and abstracting storage resources from the underlying hardware platform for greater flexibility, efficiency and rapid scalability, making storage resources programmable and scalable.</p>\\n<p>- <strong>Boyan Ivanov, CEO, <a href=\\"https://storpool.com/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">StorPool:</a></strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;The diversity from emerging applications puts strain on traditional, legacy SAN products and platforms. The storage solutions </em><em>have been largely unchanged for the last three decades, except for the introduction of faster storage media (SSDs / NVMes) and extra data management software pieces (AI, anyone?) on top of the same underlying rigid architecture. Yet the large-scale, complex, and versatile IT platforms that power businesses today need a new generation of powerful and versatile storage platforms. These storage platforms can cover multiple use-cases, performance tiers, have API-first management, and linearly scale to sizes which were impossible with the traditional SAN architecture. Besides: who wants to buy and manage five different types of SAN / AFA family groups if they can have one or two best-in-class, latest generation SDS storage solutions?&rdquo;&nbsp; </em></p>\\n<p>- <strong>Ezequiel McGovern - <a href=\\"https://www.arsat.com.ar/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">ARSAT</a>:</strong></p>\\n<p><em>&ldquo;Regarding the shared storage needs for classic solutions, the use of Ceph will be established, since it has shown in production that everything it promises is fulfilled in real life.&rdquo;</em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>The predictions seem clear and achievable. As a constantly developing software, Apache CloudStack follows the trends and evolves with the market needs. Apache CloudStack follows the open-source philosophy and has a strong and united community. It has recently been integrated with Kubernetes and extended IPv6 support for VPC and isolated networks. The Apache CloudStack use cases cover edge computing and hybrid cloud workloads. Besides that, the market for IaaS/Cloud will generate greater demand for hyperscalers, but also for service providers.</p>"},{"id":"meet-the-community-david-jumani","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/meet-the-community-david-jumani","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2022-01-13-meet-the-community-david-jumani.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-13-meet-the-community-david-jumani.md","title":"Meet the Community - David Jumani","description":"The Apache CloudStack Community is an ever-growing and rapidly-developed community of people all around the globe committed to open-source technology.

I\'m based in Bangalore, India, and currently work at ShapeBlue. I have done my Bachelor\'s Degree in Engineering in E&C. Since then, my career has been mainly in Telecommunications and Cloud management.\\nI am an avid reader who likes to devour fiction books and binge-watch series over weekends. Self-learning and self-motivation are the mantras that I follow to keep myself abreast with new things in our field of work. Never averse to taking a new role, responsibilities, and tasks that require reinventing myself.\\n\\n\\n<b>Tell us your story in one Tweet.</b>\\n\\nAn Electronics & Communications Engineer who developed an interest in networking and communications in distributed systems. Over the years, I\'ve had the opportunity to work in cloud computing, network management, cloud automation, and orchestration. I would like to give credit to my first company, where I joined as a campus recruit for providing me guidance, training, and exposure in the related field. The mentors that I had played a massive role in skill development which has played a significant role in what I am today. All this led me to an opportunity to work on CloudStack and be a part of the community.\\n\\n<b>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</b>\\n\\nIn November 2019, I started dabbling with CloudStack. It began as something that I did as part of my job. But as time passed by, I realised it was fun working on an open-source project. There are many ways to contribute and be involved, and the community members are helpful. And this journey goes on \u2026\\n\\n<b>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</b>\\n\\nRohit Yadav has been an absolute mentor right from day one. From helping me understand CloudStack to getting me around with how the community works, Rohit\'s always been there to help and support.

This integration is available for PowerFlex versions 4.3 onwards and only for the KVM hypervisor at this stage.\\n</div>\\n\\n<br/>\\n<div>\\n<b>LINBIT and CloudStack Integration</b>\\n\\n<a href=\\"/img/imported/8c768dc5-210a-41fc-911b-0f2f2f7c7453\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/8c768dc5-210a-41fc-911b-0f2f2f7c7453?t=true\\" /></a>\\n\\nSupport has also been added for Linstor storage. The plugin, again, allows CloudStack to manage Linstor volumes for primary storage and also supports snapshots.\\n\\nLINBIT SDS is deeply integrated with Apache CloudStack. It has a native driver in the OS which provides block devices to the KVM. The CloudStack integration helps administrators to manage storage functions like snapshots, migration with the API.\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n<b>Enhancements to CloudStack Kubernetes Service</b>\\n\\n<a href=\\"/img/imported/a407189f-02c6-4c71-ae99-bf0f99783fdf\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/a407189f-02c6-4c71-ae99-bf0f99783fdf?t=true\\" /></a>\\n\\nCloudStack Kubernetes Service (CKS)  first shipped in CloudStack 4.14 and provides full Kubernetes integration to CloudStack \u2013 allowing users to run containerized services using Kubernetes clusters without the pain of having to deploy Kubernetes clusters themselves\\n\\nCloudStack 4.16 brings a number of improvements to CKS. Kubernetes autoscaling is now supported through the creation of a Kubernetes provider for CloudStack. This means that Kubernetes will be able to scale up a cluster if pods cannot be scheduled and then scale it back down.\\n\\nThe base template for Kubernetes clusters in CloudStack has now been unified with the existing System VM Template, removing the dependency on CoreOS and simplifying ongoing maintenance.\\n</div>\\n\\n<h2>UI Improvements</h2>\\nThe previous release saw a new, improved user interface experience for Apache CloudStack  \u2013 for both users and administrators. 4.16 sees many new features in that interface, all designed to make interactions with CloudStack easier.\\n\\nIt is now possible to select multiple objects (i.e. Instances, volumes, etc) and perform actions against that bulk selection. For example, if you wish to restart 10 instances or lock 5 accounts, these types of actions can easily be done with a single click.\\n\\n<a href=\\"/img/imported/7dd821bd-4237-4ac8-88d9-657f97e01429\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/7dd821bd-4237-4ac8-88d9-657f97e01429\\" alt=\\"416-zone_card_view.png\\" /></a>\\n\\nThe UI has become much more visual with the addition of configurable icons for most types of resources. For example, zones can now be represented by geographical flags or instances by their OS type. Users can even upload a profile picture of themselves.\\n\\nThese icons can be configured at the administrator level and also overridden by individual users.\\n\\nUsers can also now make comments or notes against most resource types.  This can be used for making simple configuration notes or even as a full changelog against an object. This is available for most resource types including Instances, domains, hosts, SSH keypairs, volumes, snapshots, etc\\n\\nA full audit log of comments is maintained, including the date stamp and the user who made the comment. Administrators are able to create and remove comments from any object and can see all the comments on every object. Permissions are applied to domain administrators and users, allowing them to comment, remove and see comments only on the entities they have access to.\\n\\nThere is also a new \u201cComments\u201d section under the main menu, allowing users to see all of their comments across all objects and types.\\n\\n<a href=\\"/img/imported/e40e8bff-146e-445c-ace9-f48130b1f977\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/e40e8bff-146e-445c-ace9-f48130b1f977\\" alt=\\"416-comments.png\\" /></a>\\n\\nThe final UI improvement is a big time saver. Users can now submit any form by pressing CTRL Enter.\\n\\n<h2>Upgrade Improvements</h2>\\n\\nThe last few versions of CloudStack have all seen major improvements to the upgrade process, with the overall goal of \u201czero downtime upgrades\u201d getting ever closer.\\n\\n4.16 sees this work continue: the requirement to manually register the system VM Template before an upgrade has now been removed. Template registration is now automated as part of the package upgrade process.\\n\\nThe database upgrade process has also been refined and can be run without needing the root user credentials.\\n\\n<h2>Improved Tools & Management</h2>\\n\\nThe ability to import and export existing Virtual machines as CloudStack instances is an area that has seen a lot of focus in recent versions. 4.16 sees new functionality in the UI that allows admins to take existing VMWare instances for a VMWare cluster and quickly put them under CloudStack management (or to \u201cunmanage\u201d them in reverse). This functionality was previously available only as an API command.\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/imported/580a39af-db79-4391-bb0f-83404d7018b3\\" alt=\\"416-comments.png\\" />\\n\\nWhether an instance is allowed to dynamically scale can now be controlled in a very granular fashion, down to the level of a template or an individual instance. Previously, this was only configurable on a global basis. The hot adding of CPU and RAM.\\n\\nCloudStack\u2019s host HA feature has been extended to allow a host to be placed in a \u201cdegraded\u201d state. In this state, HA kicks in to migrate workloads away, but the host is left running.\\n\\nEnhancements have been made to pod management to allow administrators to be able to update the size of the IP range of the management pod, upwards or downwards.\\n\\nFinally, CloudStack 4.16 sees an overhaul of the products documentation to reflect the new user interface.\\n\\n<h2>Documentation and Downloads</h2>\\n\\nThe full list of new features can be found in the project release notes at <a href=\\"https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.16.0.0/releasenotes/changes.html\\">https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.16.0.0/releasenotes/changes.html</a>\\n\\nThe CloudStack documentation includes upgrade instructions from previous versions of Apache CloudStack, and can be found at: <a href=\\"https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.16.0.0/upgrading/index.html\\">https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/4.16.0.0/upgrading/index.html</a>\\n\\nThe official installation, administration and API documentation for each of the releases are available on our documentation page: <a href=\\"https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/\\">https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/</a>\\n\\nDownload the new release here: <a href=\\"https://cloudstack.apache.org/downloads.html\\">https://cloudstack.apache.org/downloads.html</a>"},{"id":"the-apache-software-foundation-announces3","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-apache-software-foundation-announces3","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2021-11-15-the-apache-software-foundation-announces3.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-11-15-the-apache-software-foundation-announces3.md","title":"The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache\xae CloudStack\xae v4.16","description":"The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache\xae CloudStack\xae v4.16","date":"2021-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 15, 2021","tags":[{"label":"announcement","permalink":"/blog/tags/announcement"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache\xae CloudStack\xae v4.16","tags":["announcement"],"slug":"the-apache-software-foundation-announces3"},"prevItem":{"title":"What\u2019s new in Apache CloudStack 4.16 - A Deep Dive","permalink":"/blog/what-s-new-in-apache"},"nextItem":{"title":"CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2021- November 8-12, 2021","permalink":"/blog/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2021-november"}},"content":"<b>The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache\xae CloudStack\xae v4.16</b>\\n\\n\\"In the past years, CloudStack has been proving a mature and\\neasy-to-use platform.

A person, who is friendly, open-minded and ready to help everyone in the community!\\n\\n<a href=\\"/img/imported/6d6dbf9f-d964-496f-82af-a4c764e5f865\\"><img src=\\"/img/imported/6d6dbf9f-d964-496f-82af-a4c764e5f865?t=true\\" alt=\\"Gabriel-VPACS.jpg\\" /></a>\\n\\n<b>1. What exactly is the role of VP of Apache CloudStack?</b>\\n\\nTo give some context let\u2019s start with a bit of Apache.\\n\\nThe Apache Software Foundation controls over 300+ Projects. Therefore, it is quite hard for a single Apache Board to stay close and manage all the projects.\\n\\nWith that in mind, each project holds a group of contributors capable of managing supervising the project following the Apache guidelines; this group is called Project Management Committee (PMC). A project VP is a PMC Chair appointed by the Apache Board.\\n\\nThe VP serves as a bridge between the ASF Board and the Project, providing reports to the Apache Board on a quarterly basis. VP also holds an important role in terms of marketing the project and orchestrating discussions.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<b>2. If you look at CloudStack, it has played a critical role for many solutions providers and companies who search for ease of use and deployment. Which companies can benefit the most from CloudStack?</b>\\n\\nAny company that deploys and consumes large loads of computer resources can benefit from CloudStack. Some examples are:\\n\\n\xb7 Cloud Providers: they are a perfect match as their core business is Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)\\n\\n\xb7 Telecommunications Companies: are transiting to large cloud infrastructures; especially with the wide change on the communication industry (migrating from traditional Telephone & TV to wireless mobile and Internet technologies)\\n\\n\xb7 Universities and Research Rroups: need large scale systems for running experiments and also maintaining multiple services for students, professors, and researchers\\n\\n\xb7 Enterprises / Governmental Organizations: they process and store loads of data, and need elastic computer resources to comply with their demands\\n\\nIn summary, these companies have something in common:\\n\\n1. The costs with public clouds are higher than deploying and managing their own Private Cloud.\\n\\n2. Also, some companies must control their data and will not process them on third-parties.\\n\\nIn all those cases CloudStack has proven to be a competitive option.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<b>3. Choosing a cloud management system is a hard thing, especially if you have a long history with specific technologies. Why should companies migrate to CloudStack?</b>\\n\\nThat is true. Choosing such a system is hard and it requires evaluating many aspects, such as the goals, expectations, and technical background that the company already has.\\n\\nCloudStack can handle a wide set of hypervisors, and instead of creating new components and projects, it focuses on connecting and managing solid technologies such as iSCSI, NFS, and Ceph. Additionally, it allows configuring guest networks with IPv6 protocol for VMs, which is not commonly supported by other cloud orchestration systems.\\n\\nIn short: a good thing from CloudStack for companies planning to migrate to Private Cloud is that it adopted technologies that are out in the industry for decades and most of the Admins and Engineers are already used to them. This can cut deployment and operation costs.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<b>4. On the development side, how easy it is to implement and manage CloudStack?</b>\\n\\nCloudStack, as any other cloud orchestration platform, is a complex solution; it requires IT professionals with multidisciplinary backgrounds, such as development skills (e.g. Java, Python, MySQL, Bash, Git, Node.js), as well as experience with virtualization, networking and storage systems. So it might take some time for a new developer to learn its way. However, Apache projects work hard to help newcomers; and CloudStack is no different. There are documentations that guide users, system admins, and developers. Deploying CloudStack can be easy when compared to other options and operating it can be simple to users that are well adapted with all the technologies in CloudStack.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<b>5. What would you share about the community?</b>\\n\\nThe fact that the project is managed by Apache Software Foundation provides all the Apache background on building an open-source community. It is one of our core goals to encourage experienced developers and users to help newcomers.\\n\\nOn top of that, assembling a community where everyone has a saying is one of the foundations of Apache projects. Therefore, we are always open to new ideas and feature requests.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<b>6. How do you think we can all grow the CloudStack community?</b>\\n\\nIt is very important to grow our community and I strongly believe that we should connect to students, researchers and professors in a way that we can bring young and passionate talents to develop our project.\\n\\nAdditionally, participating in conferences and writing for technical magazines can advertise Cloud computing Infrastructure-as-a-Service model as well as the CloudStack project.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<b>7. What is the direction in which CloudStack is going as a technology?</b>\\n\\nWe are working hard to keep it a reliable and stable solution; but it is also key to invest on user-friendly experience. A good project is one that can be easily deployed and used. We have been continuously enhancing the documentation; additionally, CloudStack has recently migrated to a new User Interface.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<b>8. Many community members notice that CloudStack is becoming more and more appealing for enterprises. What would you advise this type of organisations?</b>\\n\\nSmall-medium enterprises need to determine which deployment model best suits their Cloud strategy. There are pros and cons on any of the cloud options (private, public, or hybrid clouds).\\n\\nConsidering the complexity and challenges of deploying a cloud infrastructure, CloudStack is reliable, easy to deploy, and can scale well. Additionally, CloudStack supports integration with public clouds; therefore it is a great option for hybrid clouds.\\n\\nWe have many known cases of companies that use it for a long time and have scaled their CloudStack Data Centers to huge amounts of Hosts and VMs. But there are also examples of small organizations that are benefiting from private clouds either as a key component of their core business or a tool for internal IT development and growth.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<b>9. As a person, you are recognized for your contribution to CloudStack. How did you start with it?</b>\\n\\nIt all started in 2013, when I was an undergrad student working at a research lab that wanted to deploy a Cloud orchestration platform. We chose CloudStack over all the options and I began my journey on the CloudStack world.\\n\\nOn the 1st November 2013 I sent my first mail to the CloudStack mailing list with some questions regarding the process of upgrading from CloudStack 4.1.1 to 4.2.0.\\n\\nIn December of 2015 I opened my first Pull Request, which led me to work closer to the community by interacting at the mailing lists, and proposing and reviewing implementations.\\n\\nI became a committer in 2017 and worked as a Release Manager for CloudStack 4.12.0.0 in early 2018. By the end of 2018 I was invited to be part of the Apache CloudStack PMC.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<b>10. Any advice to all developers, writing new features for CloudStack?</b>\\n\\nOpen source is all about multiple developers creating and fixing code together; we must focus on maintainability, stability, and documentation.\\n\\nWhen writing new features we should think about how other developers will debug and extend the code. In summary: write code as simple as possible.\\n\\nI would recommend the following principles:\\n\\n1. Use clear and self-explaining variable names\\n\\n2. Take advantage of coding libraries to use existing tools\\n\\n3. Make it easy for other developers to work into the workflow\\n\\n4. Keep it well documented\\n\\n5. Make code reusable and avoid duplicated lines\\n<br/>\\n\\n<b>11. If you need to summarize CloudStack in 3 words, what would they be?</b>\\n\\nOpen-source reliable clouds, or simply: it goes on!"},{"id":"apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2021-03-03-apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-03-03-apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release.md","title":"Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.14.1.0","description":"The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the release of","date":"2021-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 3, 2021","tags":[{"label":"announcement","permalink":"/blog/tags/announcement"}],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.14.1.0","tags":["announcement"],"slug":"apache-cloudstack-lts-maintenance-release"},"prevItem":{"title":"Meet the Community - Gabriel Brascher - VP of Apache CloudStack","permalink":"/blog/meet-the-community-gabriel-brascher"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache\xae CloudStack\xae v4.15","permalink":"/blog/the-apache-software-foundation-announces2"}},"content":"The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the release of\\nCloudStack 4.14.1.0 as part of its LTS 4.14.x releases.

Finally, in early 2018, after reaching a promising state the results of the experiment were shared with the community, to build support and gather feedback for moving the CloudMonkey codebase to Go and deprecate the Python version.\\n<br/>\\nDuring 2018, two Go-based ports were written using two different readline and prompt libraries. The alpha / beta builds were shared with the community who tested them, reported bugs and provided valuable feedback (especially around tab-completion) which drove the final implementation. With the new rewrite CloudMonkey (for the first time) ships as a single executable file for Windows which can be easily installed and used having mostly the same user experience one would get on Linux or Mac OSX. The rewrite aims to maintain command-line tool backward compatibility as a drop-in replacement for the legacy Python-based CloudMonkey (i.e. shell scripts using legacy CloudMonkey can also use the modern CloudMonkey cmk). Legacy Python-based CloudMonkey will continue to be available for installation via pip but it will not be maintained moving forward.\\n<br/>\\nCloudMonkey 6.0 requires a final round of testing and bug-fixing before the release process will commence.

This is personally embarrassing, unacceptable, and in a more severe case could be downright dangerous.</p>\\n<H2>What happened?</H2>\\n<p>The CloudStack security team worked through the related vulnerabilities through the summer of 2015. We had advisory drafts, patches, and mitigations all ready well before the release. Far enough ahead, actually, that we forgot about the release and weren\'t paying attention to the release (at least I wasn\'t - I know others were), and didn\'t send out the advisories at the appropriate time. Part of this is due to me having become an unofficial lead/spokesperson for the security team; In the past there has been at least one occasion when others released advisories when I was not available, but usually I\'m coordinating issues and publishing announcements.</p>\\n<p>Luckily, the CloudStack Security Team works with and under the direction of the ASF security team. During one of their periodic reviews, they noticed CloudStack had loose ends on these two advisories, and asked for an update. Earlier today I realized the advisories had not been released, so here we are. </p>\\n<H2>How will we improve?</H2>\\n<p>Obviously, we don\'t want to be in this situation again. Here\'s some steps we\'re taking to minimize the chance of a repeat performance:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li> I\'ve modified the <a href=\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Release+Procedure\\">Release Procedure</a> to specifically request the release manager give the security team a heads up that a release is about to be announced. This can be a simple non-blocking email that shouldn\'t slow down the release process, but still ensure that we\'re aware of the upcoming release.</li>\\n<li>I\'ll be ensuring that other members of the security team feel comfortable crafting and releasing advisories. Like the rest of CloudStack and other ASF projects, the CloudStack security team does not have a named leader and should be able to operate if I or others are unavailable.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>In the past I\'ve referred to CloudStack as \\"critical infrastructure\\" - CloudStack powers infrastructure clouds for many large cloud providers. We take information security seriously, realizing that many depend upon our work. Vulnerabilities happen in most software at some point in time - the important part is how they are responded to. While in this case we did respond quickly to the issues and created and applied patches, we let the community down by not quickly releasing the advisories. This is an unfortunate chink in our armor, but we\'ll be taking steps to ensure it doesn\'t happen again.</p>"},{"id":"apache_cloudstack_4_6_is","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/apache_cloudstack_4_6_is","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2015-12-02-apache_cloudstack_4_6_is.md","source":"@site/blog/2015-12-02-apache_cloudstack_4_6_is.md","title":"Apache CloudStack 4.6 is released","description":"The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today the availability of Apache\u2122 CloudStack\u2122 v4.6, the turnkey Open Source cloud computing software platform used for creating private-, public-, and hybrid cloud environments.","date":"2015-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 2, 2015","tags":[{"label":"announcement","permalink":"/blog/tags/announcement"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Apache CloudStack 4.6 is released","tags":["announcement"],"slug":"apache_cloudstack_4_6_is"},"prevItem":{"title":"Two late-announced security advisories","permalink":"/blog/two_late_announced_security_advisories"},"nextItem":{"title":"CloudStack and OpenSSL CVE-2015-1793","permalink":"/blog/cloudstack_and_openssl_cve_2015"}},"content":"<p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives, announced today the availability of Apache\u2122 CloudStack\u2122 v4.6, the turnkey Open Source cloud computing software platform used for creating private-, public-, and hybrid cloud environments.</p>\\n\\n<p>Apache CloudStack clouds enable billions of dollars\' worth of business transactions annually across their clouds, and its maturity and stability has led it to has become the Open Source platform for many service providers to set up on-demand, elastic public cloud computing services, as well as enterprises and others to set up a private or hybrid cloud for use by their own employees.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\"This 4.6 release of Apache CloudStack marks a significant shift in how we release CloudStack,\\" said Sebastien Goasguen, Vice President of Apache CloudStack. \\"With a focus on quality and speed of releasing software, we implemented a new release workflow which allows us to have a production-ready release branch all the time, and allows us to quickly release new features.

As the vulnerability has existed in OpenSSL since early 2012, System VMs in Apache CloudStack versions 4.1.1-4.3 are running software using vulnerable versions of OpenSSL. This includes CloudStack\'s Virtual Router VMs, Console Proxy VMs, and Secondary Storage VMs.</p>\\n\\n<p>We are actively working on creating updated System VM templates for each recent version of Apache CloudStack, and for each of the hypervisor platforms which Apache CloudStack supports. Due to our testing and QA processes, this will take several days. In the meantime, we want to provide our users with a temporary workaround for currently running System VMs.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you are running Apache CloudStack 4.0.0-incubating through the recent 4.3 release, the following steps will help ensure the security of your cloud infrastructure until an updated version of the System VM template is available:</p>\\n\\n<h2> For KVM/Xen hosted systems</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li> As an administrator in the CloudStack web UI, navigate to Infrastructure->System VMs</li>\\n<li> For each System VM listed, note the host it is running on, and it\u2019s \u201cLink Local IP address.\\"</li>\\n<li> With that data, perform the following steps for each System VM:\\n<ol type=\\"a\\">\\n<li> ssh into that host as root</li>\\n<li> From the host, ssh into the SSVM via it\u2019s link local IP address: (e.g. ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.cloud -p 3922 169.254.3.33)</li>\\n<li> On the System VM, first run \\"apt-get update\\"</li>\\n<li> Then run apt-get install \\"openssl libssl1.0.0\\". If a dialog appears asking to restart programs, accept it\u2019s request.</li>\\n<li> Next, for Secondary Storage VMs, run /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</li>\\n<li> Log out of the System VM and host server</li>\\n</ol>\\n</li>\\n<li>Back in the CloudStack UI, now navigate to Infrastructure->Virtual Routers. For each VR, host it\'s running on and it\'s link local IP address, and then repeat steps a-f above.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h2> For VMWare hosted systems</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li> As an administrator in the CloudStack web UI, navigate to Infrastructure->System VMs</li>\\n<li> For each System VM listed, note it\'s management IP address</li>\\n<li> With that data, perform the following steps for each System VM:</li>\\n<li> From the Management Server, ssh to the System VM via it\'s management IP: (eg ssh -i /var/lib/cloud/management/.ssh/id_rsa -p 3922 root@10.40.50.8)</li>\\n<li> On the System VM, first run \\"apt-get update\\"</li>\\n<li> Then run apt-get install \\"openssl libssl1.0.0\\". If a dialog appears asking to restart programs, accept it\u2019s request.</li>\\n<li> Next, for Secondary Storage VMs, run /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</li>\\n<li> Log out of the System VM</li>\\n<li>Back in the CloudStack UI, now navigate to Infrastructure->Virtual Routers. For each VR, host it\'s running on and it\'s link local IP address, and then repeat steps a-f above.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h2>Verification</h2>\\n\\n<p>On each System VM, you can test if it has non-vulnerable openssl packages installed by listing installed packages and looking at the installed versions of openssl and libssl. As in the example below, for a system to be non-vulnerable, the packages need to be at or above version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u6:</p>\\n<pre>\\nroot@v-14-VM:~# dpkg -l|grep ssl\\nii  libssl1.0.0:i386                     1.0.1e-2+deb7u6                  i386         SSL shared libraries\\nii  openssl                              1.0.1e-2+deb7u6                  i386         Secure Socket Layer (SSL) binary and related cryptographic tools\\n</pre>\\n\\n<p>We realize that for larger installations where System VMs are being actively created and destroyed based on customer demand, this is a very rough stop-gap. The Apache CloudStack security team is actively working on a more permanent fix and will be releasing that to the community as soon as possible.</p>\\n\\n<p>For Apache CloudStack installations that secure the web-based user-interface with SSL, these may also be vulnerable to HeartBleed, but that is outside the scope of this blog post. We recommend testing your installation with [1] to determine if you need to patch/upgrade the SSL library used by any web servers (or other SSL-based services) you use.</p>\\n\\n<a target=\\"_new\\" href=\\"http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/\\">http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/</a>"},{"id":"announcing_apache_cloudstack_4_3","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/announcing_apache_cloudstack_4_3","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www/tree/main/blog/2014-03-25-announcing_apache_cloudstack_4_3.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-03-25-announcing_apache_cloudstack_4_3.md","title":"Announcing Apache CloudStack 4.3.0","description":"Flexible, scalable, Open Source Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) used by organizations such as Zynga, Datapipe, and ISWest, among others, for creating, managing, and deploying public, private, and hybrid Cloud Computing environments","date":"2014-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 25, 2014","tags":[{"label":"announcement","permalink":"/blog/tags/announcement"}],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Announcing Apache CloudStack 4.3.0","tags":["announcement"],"slug":"announcing_apache_cloudstack_4_3"},"prevItem":{"title":"How to Mitigate OpenSSL HeartBleed Vulnerability in Apache CloudStack","permalink":"/blog/how_to_mitigate_openssl_heartbleed"},"nextItem":{"title":"Realhostip Service is Being Retired","permalink":"/blog/realhostip_service_is_being_retired"}},"content":"<p>Flexible, scalable, Open Source Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) used by organizations such as Zynga, Datapipe, and ISWest, among others, for creating, managing, and deploying public, private, and hybrid Cloud Computing environments</p>\\n\\n<p>Forest Hill, MD --25 March 2014-- The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the all-volunteer developers, stewards, and incubators of more than 170 Open Source projects and initiatives, today announced Apache CloudStack v4.3, the latest feature release of the CloudStack cloud orchestration platform.</p>\\n\\n<p>Apache CloudStack is an integrated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) software platform that allows users to build feature-rich public, private, and hybrid cloud environments.

Testing, bug fix work, and documentation should be targeted to complete by code freeze on 7/28. Release is still on schedule to release by 8/19.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n    <p>We are now just 3 weeks from ACS 4.2 code freeze on 7/29. We have around 400 open defects with 100+ blockers and critical and I expect another 200 new defects to come in. As a community we have been fixing roughly 100 defects per week, in order to clear up our backlog I request you to help out on aggressively fixing the issues. The unassigned issue list is available at <a href=\\"http://s.apache.org/BlH/\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">http://s.apache.org/BlH/</a>. When you fix a bug in 4.2 please make sure it is also fixed in master.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Given the debate on system template changes in last few days of 4.1 requiring big testing effort and potential regression, I would like to see that as community we lock down system templates for 4.2 pretty soon. If any changes are needed we should call it out now and get them resolved.</p>\\n\\n    <p>As for bugs here is a summary for this week:</p>\\n    <div class=\'table-wrap\'>\\n\\t<table

class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">support for Swift is broken due to the object store refactor</a>. There\'s been a fair amount of discussion on how an extant feature could be broken without being exposed via testing, and what should be done about it at this stage. </p>\\n\\n<p>David Nalley says that \\"unplanned/unannounced deprecation of a feature is a blocker IMO.

I\'m -1 on us saying \'we\'ll drop Swift support\'. If necessary, I\'d say that we need to roll back the object-store branch merge... I don\'t want to see that happen, though. That\'s why I\'m asking about the effort to fix it.\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Chip <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/r3rqsxnrsvjm7gwx\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">opened CLOUDSTACK-3400</a> as a blocker against 4.2 until Swift support is fixed.

For example, Alex Huang <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/z2hzz7efujgmhfnh\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">opened a discussion about the CloudStack coding conventions</a> on July 2nd, saying \\"Our <a href=\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Coding+conventions\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">coding conventions</a> have been going all over the place recently.

If it followed even our current coding conventions, this would have been 11 lines but it ends up to be 23 lines,<br/>\\n    more than doubled.  The whole file was like this.  Just thinking about all the extra scrolling I have to do makes my cts act up.  We are in the 21st century<br/>\\n    and using wide screen lcd monitors.  Let\'s not format our code to fit 80 column amber text screens please!</p>\\n\\n    <p>What\'s worse is I\'ve found that some people are actively breaking existing source code to 80 columns, causing a bunch of unnecessary merge activities. </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>For those folks who use Eclipse <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/frkn3pm7tc74yqvk\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Alex has checked in his Eclipse profile to tools/eclipse/eclipse.epf</a>.

The current namespace has been in place since the original Cloud.com implementation. As Dharmesh states, this is a big change, please join the discussion on how we can make this a successful switchover.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n    <p>Since the CloudStack project has moved to ASF, the suggestion is to move from com.cloud packages to org.apache java packages.(<a href=\\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-212\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-212</a>)</p>\\n\\n    <p>As you might be realize, this is pretty big change. And merging this changes with a continuously updating master is non-trivial. So, here is the planned strategy after discussion over IRC. I am starting this thread to inform and know everyone\'s opinions.</p>\\n\\n    <p>1. I will be pushing code with new packages on branch \\"namespacechanges\\" and will notify on this thread as each refactored module is pushed.</p>\\n\\n    <p>2. There will be a freeze on master branch commits for some time in which \\"namespacechanges\\" will be applied to master. I suggest the date to be 20th July.</p>\\n\\n    <p>3. All the branch-owner updates their branch for reflect new packages. It was suggested that branch owners can look into the \\"namespacechanges\\" branch as it grows and start doing the package changes early, although it depends on branch-owners.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-10July2013-InDevelopmentReleaseNaming\\"></a>In-Development Release Naming</h5>\\n\\n<p>While we are still hard at work at getting 4.2 out the ready and out to the world, John Burwell has <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/dxv7aeirjz5itwdp\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">proposed</a> moving to release naming until a release has gotten to feature freeze and it can be judged on what the semantic version number change should be. There\'s been a lot of discussion on this topic. We would probably look to start this in the next release if it can come to a vote. </p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n    <p>Since we have adopted Semantic Versioning [<a href=\\"http://semver.org/\\">1</a>], it seems odd that we designate a release version before the final set of enhancements/fixes has been identified.  For example, the release proceeding 4.2 may contain no backwards compatible API changes to be 4.3.  Conversely, we may decide during the development cycle, as a community, to accept a non-backwards compatible change which would bump the version to 5.0.0.  As such, it is difficult to know in advance what the proper semantic version number will be at when the work is released.  We run the risk of confusing our users if we start calling a pending release say 4.3.0, and accept a change mid-cycle that will bump it to 5.0.0.  To address this potential issue, I proposed that we refer to releases by a codename until feature freeze when we understand the complete scope of change and can apply the correct semantic version number.  I further propose we codename the release directly proceeding 4.2 \\"Gamma Rays\\" or \\"Gamma Rays Gonna Get Ya\\".  </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<h3><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-10July2013-CloudStackPlanet\\"></a>CloudStack Planet</h3>\\n\\n<p>What\'s going on in the CloudStack community?

There is currently no motion in the community to extend the freeze date, and Animesh Chaturvedi is keep the release on schedule.

Ilya Musayev is the release manager for the 4.1.x branch, and has <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/6ionwrcqlh4pi2j4\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">asked</a> work all merges to be completed. Once that is done, he will call for a VOTE.</p>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1July2013-LargeMerge%2FReleaseWork\\"></a>Large Merge / Release Work</h5>\\n\\n<p>As we seen in the past and now again in 4.2, it\'s important to focus on merging your features early and often. By breaking up large merge and code review requests it is possible to help keep releases on schedule, get features in before the freeze and avoid Veto votes. Alex Huang and Kelven Yang worked really hard on a new and large VMSync feature that many users need. Because it came in so close to freeze and was a large merge request with less than a week before freeze it immediately received Veto votes blocking the merge. Even with the help of several other committers the review couldn\'t be done in a timely fashion and miss the 4.2 cutoff.</p>\\n\\n<p>When late requests come in like this it also puts undo stress on the testing of the release as well. Read through the <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/zgwtc5nzm3bpmic2\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">merge thread</a> to follow the discussion on how we can improve this in the future.</p>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1July2013-BVTAutomationTestingBreaks\\"></a>BVT Automation Testing Breaks</h5>\\n\\n<p>After complaints that the BVT environment was broken, Alex Huang did some investigating to identify the root cause and raise a suggest on how BVT testing should be <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/si6rt2mkc7dt4krw\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">dealt with in the future</a>. </p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>After Dave\'s complain in the vmsync <a href=\\"/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CLOUDSTACK&amp;title=MERGE&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=31825135\\" class=\\"createlink\\">MERGE</a> thread about BVT in horrible shape on master, I went around to figure out what exactly happened.  The best I can figure is that after a certain merge (I will leave out which merge as that\'s not important), BVT no longer runs automatically.  It was promised to be fixed and there are people who are actively fixing it but it\'s been in this way for about two weeks.  People running BVTs are working around the problem but it\'s not automated anymore and so it\'s no longer running on master.  I understand people are nice and tried to be accommodating to other people by working around the problem but sometimes we just have to be an arse.  So let me be that arse...</p>\\n\\n<p>New Rule....<br/>\\nIf BVT or automated regression tests break on master or any release branch, we revert all commits that broke it.  It doesn\'t matter if they promise to fix it within the next hour.  If it\'s broken, the release manager will revert the commits and developers must resubmit.  It sounds mean but it\'s the only way this problem can be fixed.  </p>\\n\\n<p>To avoid having a bunch of reverts and resubmits, the developers should be able to request that BVT run on their branch and don\'t merge until BVT on their branch is at 100%.  We will work on figuring out how to do that.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1July2013-CloudMonkeyandPyPIReleases\\"></a>CloudMonkey and PyPI Releases</h5>\\n\\n<p>On June 9th, Rohit Yadav asked about a problem with the 4.1.0-0 CloudMonkey release on PyPI lacking the fail safe API cache.

The autodiscovery using sync is useful but only with the ApiDiscovery plugin which works only for 4.2 and later. For 4.1 and below I think we should, in that case, bundle the cache for all the apis. Or maybe<br/>\\njust oss components/plugins?</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>David replied that \\"this is exactly why I\'ve been <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/wir5vfawex3y22ot\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">suggesting that we break CloudMonkey (and Marvin) out of the main repo</a>\\" and give them their own lifecycle. \\"It\'s far easier/faster to iterate cloudmonkey than all of CloudStack and tying it to the slower lifecycle of ACS will continue to trouble it IMO.\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>Rohit replied that \\"we should do it then.\\" Prasanna Santhanam replied, \\"I haven\'t given breaking out the project much thought.

This is the first major release from Apache CloudStack since its graduation from the Apache Incubator on March 20th. </p>\\n\\n<p>Apache CloudStack is an integrated software platform that allows users to build a feature-rich IaaS. CloudStack includes an intuitive user interface and rich API for managing the compute, networking, accounting, and storage resources for private, hybrid, or public clouds. </p>\\n\\n<p>The 4.1.0 release represents more than five months of development effort by the Apache CloudStack community. The release includes many new features and bugfixes from the 4.0.x cycle. The 4.1.0 release also marks major changes in the codebase to make CloudStack easier for developers, a new structure for creating RPM/Debian packages, and completes the changeover to using Maven as a build tool.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\"newfeatures\\">New Features</h2>\\n\\n<p>Some of the notable new features in Apache CloudStack 4.1.0 include:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>An API discovery service that allows an end point to list its supported APIs and their details.</li>\\n<li>Added an Events Framework to CloudStack to provide an &#8220;event bus&#8221; with publish, subscribe, and unsubscribe semantics. Includes a RabbitMQ plugin that can interact with AMQP servers. Introduces the notion of a state change event.</li>\\n<li>Implement L3 router functionality in the Nicira NVP plugin, and including support for KVM (previously Xen-only).</li>\\n<li>API request throttling to prevent attacks via frequent API requests.</li>\\n<li>AWS-style regions.</li>\\n<li>Egress firewall rules for guest networks.</li>\\n<li>Resizing root and data volumes.</li>\\n<li>Reset SSH key to access VMs.</li>\\n<li>Support for EC2 Query API.</li>\\n<li>Autoscaling support in conjunction with load balancing devices such as NetScaler.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\"downloads\\">Downloads</h2>\\n\\n<p>The official source is available from:</p>\\n\\n<p>http://cloudstack.apache.org/downloads.html</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to the official source code release, individual contributors also make convenience binaries available. 4.1.0 convenience binaries should be available within a day or so of the release announcement.</p>\\n\\n<p>Note that there is a known issue with 4.1.0 and a recent Tomcat release. This has been addressed in the convenience binaries, but is still present in 4.1.0 source release. We will be working on a 4.1.1 release that will contain that fix shortly.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\"cloudstackcollaborationconference\\">CloudStack Collaboration Conference</h2>\\n\\n<p>The CloudStack community will be gathering for its second conference this month in Santa Clara, CA. The event will start on June 23rd with a hackathon, then formal programming on June 24th and 25th. This year we&#8217;ve gotten some fantastic keynotes, including DevOps legend Gene Kim (author of &#8220;The Phoenix Project&#8221;).

After much discussion, <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/rqqbtbumx6xnzrcr\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Animesh summed up the discussion</a> saying:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I still see there is difference of opinion and not a clear consensus with 12 out<br/>\\nof 21 ( approx. 60%) preferring 6 months.  But going by the argument of not<br/>\\nhaving given proper shot to 4 month cycle I will say we can keep 4.2 as a 4<br/>\\nmonth cycle and pull in all effort to make it successful.  If it turns out that<br/>\\nwe can work with 4 month schedule that\'s well and good otherwise we can bring<br/>\\nthis topic again based on the results of running 4 month cycle.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-4.1.0Approaches\\"></a>4.1.0 Approaches</h5>\\n\\n<p>After clearing out a number of last-minute blockers, it looks like 4.1.0 may be just about ready to roll. Chip Childers <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/fe44ea4vy4yughwm\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">posted on Friday</a> that he was waiting on confirmation on CLOUDSTACK-528 and CLOUDSTACK-2194 being fixed.

URLs<br/>\\ngenerated by Apache CloudStack to provide console access to virtual<br/>\\nmachines contained a hash of a predictable sequence, the hash of<br/>\\nwhich was generated with a weak algorithm. While not easy to leverage,<br/>\\nthis may allow a malicious user to gain unauthorized console access.</p>\\n\\n<p>Mitigation:<br/>\\nUpdating to Apache CloudStack versions 4.0.2 or higher will mitigate<br/>\\nthese vulnerabilities.</p>\\n\\n<p>Credit:<br/>\\nThese issues were identified by Wolfram Schlich and Mathijs Schmittmann<br/>\\nto the Citrix security team, who in turn notified the Apache<br/>\\nCloudStack PMC.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-ExposingAPIsthatcarryPOSTdata\\"></a>Exposing APIs that carry POST data</h5>\\n\\n<p>Prasanna Santhanam <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/ji4d23xozub3nehi\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">raised a discussion</a> about adding the ability to send user data as POST to commands. </p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I\'m guessing we\'ll have to put in additional annotations on our APIs<br/>\\nthat support POST so that API discovery can print the methods<br/>\\nsupported (GET/POST). Right now it\'s only the deployVMCmd (AFAIK). But<br/>\\nI expect this will need to be done for others soon.</p>\\n\\n<p>I\'ve included POST support for <em>every</em> command in marvin but that\'s<br/>\\njust brute-force. To make it more intelligent I think we should apply<br/>\\nit to only apis that make sense as POST (causing side-effects). But<br/>\\nthat needs to be exposed by the api endpoint.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-29April2013-EnablingGitHubPullRequestNotification\\"></a>Enabling GitHub Pull Request Notification</h5>\\n\\n<p>A discussion was brought up on dev@ this weekend about enabling notifications for pull requests made via GitHub. David Nalley <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/f6cmckyakfa6sof4\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">remarked</a> that in his opinion, \\"there really isn\'t an option - if we are going to have a GitHub mirror, we also need to be able to deal with the pull requests there.

While we try to pull out the discussions that are \\"don\'t miss\\" discussions to anyone who\'s involved in using or contributing to CloudStack, it\'s a really good idea to <a href=\\"http://cloudstack.apache.org/mailing-lists.html\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">make sure you\'re subscribed</a> to the mailing lists and follow along. </p>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-22April2013-ReleaseSchedule\\"></a>Release Schedule</h5>\\n\\n<p>Animesh Chaturvedi <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/6suq2fhltdvgvcxd\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">started a discussion last week</a> about the release schedule for 4.2.0, trying to nail down the specific dates for feature freeze, docs freeze, etc. That was <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/cp23tewephjuxv7f\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">accompanied by a question of whether we should consider a six-month cycle</a>. Ultimately, no resolution was reached on the schedule. </p>\\n\\n<p>Animesh has <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/3ctdwor5hfbpa3vx\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">started a new thread to discuss the release cycle</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-22April2013-EasierSimpleInstalls\\"></a>Easier Simple Installs</h5>\\n\\n<p>David has <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/zvo3t26zjvedblah\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">started a conversation on dev@ about the ease, or lack thereof, of installing CloudStack</a>. David says, \\"what I want to do is get rid of sections 2-4 of the quick install guide, and replace it with - \'run this one or two lines worth of commands\' (<a href=\\"http://s.apache.org/runbook\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">http://s.apache.org/runbook</a>).\\" David describes what he\'d like to see: </p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The all-in-one installation process I\'d like to see:</p>\\n\\n<p>Install your host OS Install an meta-RPM/Deb that either (installs everything, or alternatively configures a repo - or just installs the repo and the stuff I need to install with) Run a command that activates one of these config tools - configures the machine, installs the packages I need, and gets me to the point where I\'m ready to login and go through the beautiful new user gui setup stuff. </p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>No further comments on this so far. </p>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-22April2013-DevelopingaStorageBackupObjectStorePluginFramework\\"></a>Developing a Storage Backup Object Store Plugin Framework</h5>\\n\\n<p>Min Chin <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/cspb6xweeupfvpit\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">has proposed a storage backup object store plugin framework</a> that would \\"allow CloudStack to systematically manage and configure various types of backup data stores from different vendors, like NFS, S3, Swift, etc.\\" Specifically, Min says:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>With this new plugin framework, we would like to achieve following functionalities: </p>\\n\\n<p>1. Support different object store providers in a uniform and pluggable fashion. <br/>\\n2. Enable region wide object backup using S3-like object store. <br/>\\n3. Provide pluggable data motion strategies to handle data transfer from one data store to another data store. <br/>\\n4. Provide a scalable cache storage framework while moving data between primary storage and backup storage for certain hypervisor needs.  <br/>\\n5. Support flexible combinations of primary storage, secondary storage and hypervisors, such as (NFS, NFS, Xen), (NF3, S3, Vmware), (ISCSI, Swift, KVM), ..., etc.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>The FS is <a href=\\"https://cwiki.apache.org/CLOUDSTACK/storage-backup-object-store-plugin-framework.html\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">on the wiki</a>, and Min says in a follow-up that there\'s a plan to \\"provide a sample plugin implementation\\" for the work.</p>\\n\\n<p>With regards to compatibility concerns, Edison Su <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/sstnaimx62mnyles\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">responds</a> that existing APIs \\"can still be wired to new code\\" so that they continue to work, but \\"we can mark them as deprecated in the API document.\\" Edison also notes that it can co-exist with the existing deployments and upgrades from pre-4.2.0 versions to 4.2.0 if the feature is accepted.</p>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-22April2013-VOTEsfor4.1.0and4.0.2\\"></a>VOTEs for 4.1.0 and 4.0.2</h5>\\n\\n<p>After a couple of false starts, it looks like the third time is the charm for the 4.0.2 release. Joe Brockmeier <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/nfe2lyxj4mjsmxdb\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">started the third voting round on Saturday 20 April</a>, and it has quite a few +1 (binding) votes so far. Unless -1\'ed by Tuesday morning, it will be ready for release. </p>\\n\\n<p>Chip has also <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/thread/vfcje3fs5ilvm47c\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">started the first vote</a> for 4.1.0, which will be open for 72 hours - assuming no show-stopping defects are found, and it garners at least 3 +1 PMC votes. Note that <b>everyone</b> in the CloudStack community is encouraged to test out the release candidate and cast a vote, regardless of whether the vote is \\"binding\\" or not. More testing is always better, and an informed -1 from a non-PMC member isn\'t going to be ignored when deciding whether to release or not. </p>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-22April2013-DomainAdminLimitations\\"></a>Domain Admin Limitations</h5>\\n\\n<p>Pranav Saxena has <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/ucxsapyannat2z6b\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">raised a discussion about the limitations for DOMAIN admins</a>, and wonders \\"why hasn\'t the domain -admin been given the privilege of creating sub-child domains himself? Are there any concerns/threats because of which the current architecture doesn\'t serve this purpose?\\" Alena Prokharchyk responds that there <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/nyzosjot2ov5lb7m\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">may be a feature request matching Pranav\'s concerns</a> and suggests checking its status.

This week there was another breakage in master, <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/thread/sqxci3hswfmrionn\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">and a discussion following about database access during tests</a>. One proposal was to disable the database before running tests, but this has been challenged as being overly complicated for developers who may be running CloudStack on their test machines and find it inconvenient to disable the db when running tests.</p>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-8April2013-PreparingtheBoardReport\\"></a>Preparing the Board Report</h5>\\n\\n<p>As an Incubating project, Apache CloudStack prepared a board report every three months, which would be reviewed by the IPMC and (if approved) sent up to the board as part of the Apache Incubator report.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now that Apache CloudStack is a top-level project (TLP), it prepares its own report for the board. Chip Childers <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/thread/s7sx3fgfkb6hsbqy\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">started the discussion on the mailing list</a> with a draft of the report.</p>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-8April2013-AssigningTickets\\"></a>Assigning Tickets </h5>\\n\\n<p>Noah Slater <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/ngt2o3wqh5fm6n6y\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">raised an issue</a> about ticket assignments:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Right now, we have people who are regularly going through JIRA and triaging tickets. This is totally fantastic, and a very valuable activity for the project. (So thank you!) But I also notice that specific individuals are being assigned to the tickets in the process.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is a form of \\"cookie licking\\". The analogy is that if you fancy a cookie, but you\'re too hungry right now, you take a lick of it so nobody else can touch it. This is an anti-pattern and we should try to avoid it. </p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>As a result, Noah suggested that we change the way that ticket assignments are handled so that people are taking tickets as they get a chance to work on them, rather than taking tickets that they plan to work on. </p>\\n\\n<h3><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-8April2013-CloudStackPlanetPostsfromtheCloudStackCommunity\\"></a>CloudStack Planet - Posts from the CloudStack Community</h3>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Chip Childers: \\"<a href=\\"http://www.chipchilders.com/blog/2013/4/4/apache-cloudstack-graduation-news-roundup.html\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Apache CloudStack Graduation News Roundup</a>\\" Chip rounds up some of the reports on the Apache CloudStack graduation.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n<h3><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-8April2013-UpcomingEvents\\"></a>Upcoming Events</h3>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><b>Open Cloud Challenges</b> at the Data Center Expo, Paris, April 10th <a href=\\"http://www.datacenter-expo.com/info_event/80/cloud-open-source---les-communautes-open-cloud-et-leurs-defis.html\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Open Cloud</a>.</li>\\n\\t<li><b>Cloud Computing</b> at the University of British Columbia (Robson Campus), Vancouver, Canada, April 9th.</li>\\n\\t<li><b>CloudStack Introduction and Basics</b> - The inaugural meeting of the <a href=\\"http://meetup.com/CloudStack-NYC-User-Group/\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">CloudStack NYC User Group</a> will be Wednesday, April 10th in New York City. <a href=\\"http://www.meetup.com/CloudStack-NYC-User-Group/events/106104162/\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Sign up on Meetup.com</a>.</li>\\n\\t<li><b>UK/European CloudStack user group</b> <a href=\\"http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5816841329/eorg\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">meet-up</a> will be April 11th in London.</li>\\n\\t<li><b>Storage in Apache CloudStack</b> being held by the <a href=\\"http://www.meetup.com/CloudStack-SF-Bay-Area-Users-Group/events/108916562/\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">CloudStack SF Bay Area Users Group</a> on April 30, 2013 @ Citrix Conference Center, sign up on the Meetup.com Website.</li>\\n\\t<li><b>CloudStack Bangalore Meetup</b> Sometime in April, date not yet announced.

This week, Murali explained in more detail what he was thinking:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>CloudStack need not have a native capability to move IP across zone. From the CloudStack core perspective, all we need is abstraction of moving IP (presented as NAT) across the zones. Then we can have specific intelligence in the plug-ins which are providing EIP service. For e.g.\'Route Health Injection\' is commonly used solution in distributed data centres for disaster recovery supported by multiple vendors.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-1April2013-UpgradeProcessfrom4.0.xto4.1.0\\"></a>Upgrade Process from 4.0.x to 4.1.0</h5>\\n\\n<p>Wido den Hollander <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/5at5p2hasjltkt5z\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">started a discussion about how upgrades will work</a> for 4.0.x to 4.1.0, given the package renaming taking place in 4.1.0.

It is a well-established cloud management platform, already widely in production use by many organizations. It is used to deliver Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud computing in both private-cloud, public, and hybrid cloud environments. It has been proven to be both stable and highly scalable, underpinning production clouds more than 30,000 physical nodes, in geo-distributed environments.</p>\\n\\n<p>Asked to comment on the importance of becoming a Top-Level Project, Childers added \\"CloudStack had the advantage of having many long-term, large deployments which had proven the stability and scalability of the technology. This helped us concentrate on adopting the \'Apache Way\' of governance, which is well understood and open, delivering so many great pieces of software over the years.\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>\\"We know that Infrastructure-as-a-Service is the next generation of IT infrastructure, and that people will demand open standards and open governance for such an important layer in their IT stack. That is why the CloudStack project meeting the rigorous standards of ASF governance is so significant. \\"</p>\\n\\n<p>When asked to comment on the Apache CloudStack community itself, Childers said: \\"we\'ve managed to build a diverse, friendly and very open community around CloudStack. New members receive a really warm welcome and we make sure that all contributors are on an equal footing, whether they are writing code or helping with any other aspect of the project. Anybody thinking of getting involved in the project would quickly find what a great community we are. As well as online involvement, we\'ve already had a global collaboration conference and there are many CloudStack groups established in many different countries. \\"</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>About Apache CloudStack</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Apache CloudStack is a complete software suite for creating Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds. Target environments include service providers and enterprises. It is used by many service providers to set up an on-demand, elastic cloud computing services and by enterprises to set up a private cloud for use by their own employees. Apache CloudStack is also available to individuals and organizations that wish to study and implement an IaaS for personal, educational, and/or production use.</p>\\n\\n<p>Further information on Apache CloudStack can be found at <a href=\\"http://cloudstack.apache.org/\\">cloudstack.apache.org</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>About Apache Software Foundation</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>The Apache Software Foundation, a US 501(3)(c) non-profit corporation, provides organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range of over 140 open source software projects.

This is an issue because CloudStack supports each account having their own private IP ranges and two accounts can use the same private IP range. For example, by default if you create a network with source nat and you do not specify any gateway or subnet data, it will give you 10.1.1.0/24 as an IP range. This means it will be very likely that two CloudStack accounts will be using the same private IP space.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Alex <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/iyydkgxzvbzmo4jw\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">replied</a>, \\"There is a mode in CloudStack that only allows non-intersecting cidrs for guest networks.

While there are still rough edges for us to work through over time, we are dealing with our problems quite well as a community. The simple reason that I believe we are in a position to ask to graduate, is that we are no longer getting value from the incubation process!  That\'s a good thing, because it means that we have managed to learn quite a bit about the ASF processes, rules, methods and preferences.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Marcus Sorensen <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/l2kqj2gppghm4f2q\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">agreed</a> that there are rough edges but, \\"the incubation process itself may not teach us anything further about these things, and they\'re just things we need to iron out over time.\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>David Nalley wrote:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I don\'t see us actively receiving any benefit from continuing in incubation. We are far from perfect, but the project seems to be policing itself. So I am not seeing a huge incentive to staying.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are also some downsides to remaining in incubation. First there\'s the label \'incubation\' that follows almost everything we do, and is potentially off-putting to potential community members. Second as a community there are a number of things we can\'t do for ourselves, and thus have to ask permission or for help - this includes votes on releases, creating new user accounts, etc. I think of this as the overhead of being in the incubator.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18February2013-DiscussiononDatabaseChangesandMerges\\"></a>Discussion on Database Changes and Merges</h5>\\n\\n<p>Rohit Yadav <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/thread/z32xdbr2injgjrrp\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">put out the word</a> that there were database changes ahead for the 4.1 branch and master. </p>\\n\\n<p>Rohit also brought up a merge for <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/2v3hqmanasol6okw\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">database schemas for 4.1.0</a> and pointed to the <a href=\\"http://people.apache.org/~bhaisaab/diff-create-schema-40-41.sql\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">current differences in the database schema for 4.1 over 4.0</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18February2013-Documentationfor4.1\\"></a>Documentation for 4.1</h5>\\n\\n<p>Sebastien Goasguen <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/rjbctl6uu3qu2c7g\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">started a thread on documentation for 4.1</a>, which is a must-read for anyone working on docs. </p>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-18February2013-HowtoTreatBrokenBuilds\\"></a>How to Treat Broken Builds</h5>\\n\\n<p>David Nalley expressed some <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/thread/bb7qgl3esc25cdek\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">frustration with the community\'s reaction to broken builds</a>. </p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>In general it seems we don\'t care, and this makes it more difficult to fix problems. Jenkins reporting a broken build (be it a broken run of RAT, failure to compile, failure of a unit test, building docs, etc.) should be our <a href=\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andon_(manufacturing)\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Andon cord</a>. We should all stop commits that aren\'t fixing the broken build. To illustrate why this is a problem, RAT failures started occurring recently, this keeps us from testing whether CloudStack builds, because each build is conditioned on the successful completion of the test before it. That in turn keeps apidocs from building,  which keeps marvin from building, which keeps documentation from building. We essentially are blind until it gets fixed.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Marcus Sorensen asked <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/2kjhnje2zgocobbt\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">if there was a Jenkins report committers could subscribe to</a> in order to avoid the problem.

While it will delay inclusion into CloudStack <b>slightly</b>, the feature will be well-poised to go into 4.2 and the additional attention that the discussion has raised will likely make it that much better a feature when merged to master. It also means that a single feature won\'t delay the 4.1 release, which already has quite a lot of improvements and new features that CloudStack users will want to have ready when it\'s scheduled for release.</p>\\n\\n<h5><a name=\\"ApacheCloudStackWeeklyNews-4February2013-ProposaltoDeprecatethenonRESTfulAPIsandAPIServer\\"></a>Proposal to Deprecate the non-RESTful APIs and API Server</h5>\\n\\n<p>Rohit Yadav has <a href=\\"http://markmail.org/message/3nmgl5peuxeo4mvm\\" class=\\"external-link\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">proposed deprecating CloudStack\'s non-RESTful APIs and API server</a> over a reasonable timeline.
