You will be able to<strong> <!-- -->learn more about different software solutions, which can be combined with CloudStack</strong> and dive deep into specialized<!-- --> <strong>Technical Solution Briefs</strong> <!-- -->presenting the integrations.</p><p>Today we will introduce you to <a href="https://tungsten.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tungsten.</a></p><h1>Tungsten Fabric&#x27;s Integration with Apache CloudStack</h1><p>Tungsten Fabric (TF) comprises components like controller and vRouter; plus additional components for analytics and third-party integration. In this Solution Brief, TF integrates with CloudStack as an SDN plugin to enable rich networking capabilities and lifecycle management of VMs and containers where TF components or control functions are deployed.</p><p>The deployment and life-cycle management of Tungsten Fabric can be done with tools like Ansible. After Tungsten Fabric and CloudStack are installed, we need to create a zone with the TF isolation method, and then, when we create a network or a vm in CloudStack, TF plugin will call the TF Controller API to create the resources.</p><a href="/img/imported/d1ccefda-ebb0-4208-9835-57d1aed4922b"><b>DOWNLOAD THE SOLUTION BRIEF</b></a><br><br><strong>Key Outcomes for Users</strong><p>Apache Cloudstack has long provided flexibility regarding network configuration to serve the needed use case. Along with built-in functionality, ACS has supported a number of different Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers, including VMware NSX multi-hypervisor (formally Nicara), Nuage and others.</p><p>However, Apache CloudStack lacked a fully-featured open-source SDN controller to deliver advanced networking features.  </p><p>Apache Cloudstack&#x27;s integration with Tungsten Fabric will finally close this feature gap providing many long sought-after features, including BGP, MPLS, service stitching and deep security policy capabilities to meet even the most stringent industry requirements.</p><p>CloudStack will be able to manage these advanced functions via tight integration with the underlying best-of-breed network controller, while Tungsten Fabric handles the network fabric. </p><p><span><strong>The Community Adopting the Integration of Apache CloudStack and Tungsten Fabric</strong></span></p><p>A number of community members have already adopted Tungsten Fabric as part of their cloud infrastructure. We reached out to the community to hear their thoughts on the integration and how it benefits their organisation.</p><p><em>‘’The EWERK Group mainly serves organizations in system-relevant industries with regulated IT. In these industries, highly complex IT infrastructure projects place special demands on the network. In order to meet these requirements, a future-oriented further development with the highest demand on technological know-how and flexibility of the software is needed. The support of Tungsten Fabric helps us to meet these requirements.’’</em></p><p>-       <strong>Sven Vogel, Senior Manager R&amp;D for Cloud and Infrastructure - </strong><a href="https://www.ewerk.com/startseite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>EWERK</strong></a></p><p><em>&quot;ENA is committed to the continued success of Apache CloudStack and we felt integrating Tungsten Fabric, a class leading open source Software Defined Networking (SDN) product addresses a key feature gap&quot;</em>, remarked Simon Weller. <em>&quot;ENA has been part of Apache CloudStack since its inception and we&#x27;re proud that we&#x27;re able to continue our work within the ACS community&quot;.</em></p><p>-       <strong>Simon Weller, VP of Technology – </strong><a href="https://www.ena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Education Networks of America</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>About Tungsten Fabric</strong></p><p>Tungsten Fabric is an open-source network and security orchestrator which provides secure connectivity for cloud-native environments. Tungsten Fabric enables developers, network and security operations staff to deploy zero-trust micro-segmentation within a DevOps workflow to reduce the friction in application deployment. It ensures performance and security for deployments of tens of thousands of nodes at Tier 1 service providers, major research centers and enterprises with global operations.</p><p>With Tungsten Fabric, security and network engineers can build secure microservices that can be deployed on various container orchestration platforms, allowing them to work directly within the DevOps workflow. This ensures applications and infrastructure alike are secure against sophisticated attacks, while increasing development velocity and site reliability. Tungsten Fabric analytics provide flow-level visibility, while port mirroring provides application-level visibility. </p><p>Together these features enable network and security operations staff, streamlining troubleshooting and mean time to resolution (MTTR). Tungsten Fabric manages and implements physical and virtual networking and security for cloud environments. Since the same controller and forwarding components are used in every implementation, Tungsten Fabric provides a consistent interface for managing connectivity and policy in all the environments it supports, and can provide seamless and secure connectivity between workloads managed by different orchestrators, whether virtual machines or containers.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/cloudstack-european-user-group-may">CloudStack European User Group - May 4th, 2023</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-01-13T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">January 13, 2023</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/4a13eac1-472a-49ae-ba58-51d6b46b63d2"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/4a13eac1-472a-49ae-ba58-51d6b46b63d2" alt="CSEUG 23 Banner.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><strong>Apache CloudStack is thrilled to share that the spring edition of CloudStack European User Group 2023 is now official!

We collaborated on a successful major release - Apache CloudStack 4.17 bringing a bunch of new capabilities and improvements, as well as created multiple new CloudStack integrations. As well as this, the community created two minor releases as part of the LTS programme.</p><p>The community also held two successful conferences, one of which being the first in-person CloudStack Collaboration Conference since the pandemic. The new &amp;&quot;Year in Review&quot; blogs series encourages us to reflect on the community<!-- -->’<!-- -->s achievements, and thus lets us brainstorm the ways we will further develop Apache CloudStack in all facets in the new year. Find out what we managed to achieve together and what is coming in 2023 in this recap article!</p><span><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/what-s-new-in-apache1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><span>Apache CloudStack 4.17 Release</span></strong></a></span><p>The year saw the newest major release - Apache CloudStack 4.17, which brought a number of new and exciting features being introduced, including:</p><ul><li><span><span><strong><span>Zero Downtime Upgrades for Virtual Routers</span></strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>With this new feature, the virtual router does not have to go through the process of complete removal and instantiating a new one involving shutdown, resource release, system VM template copy from secondary storage to primary, starting and VR configuration</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Previously when a new release of Apache CloudStack was deployed, the operations team had to organize maintenance windows to allow the redeployment of every virtual router. Now an in-place upgrade of CloudStack virtual routers can be performed with zero downtime.</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong><span>VR Live Patching</span></strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>Underpinning zero downtime upgrades is the new feature VR live patching. This feature can also be used independently of upgrades and allow CloudStack admins to apply software updates to Virtual Routers on the fly. Previously all Apache CloudStack scripts to manage the Virtual Router were stored in an ISO image and mounted during the first boot and then copied to the Virtual Router. Now the update is performed dynamically , as long as the base OS remains constant , users to not need to recreate the Virtual Router.</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><strong><span><span>IPv6 support for Isolated and VPC Networks</span></span></strong></span></li></ul><p><span><span><span>IPv6 is considered a natural evolution of any system that intends to be present in computing environments in the future. The RIPE NCC, which assigns IP addresses in 76 countries to ISPs and other organizations, got its final allocation of IPv4 addresses from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in 2012.</span></span></span><br><span><span><span>Apache CloudStack already supported IPv6 for Shared Networks; now IPv6 is also supported for Isolated Networks and VPC. Users can deploy IPv6 networks where routing is currently static, allowing users to use subnets of IPv6 networks directly in CloudStack instances.</span><br><span>In this context, unlike IPv4 that relies on NAT to deliver network services to users, the Virtual Router behaves like a real router, routing IPv6 packets and allowing users to configure firewall.</span></span></span></p><ul><li><span><strong><span><span>Self-service Network Improvements</span></span></strong></span></li></ul><p><span><span>Previously, the creation of Shared Networks and Private Gateways was an admin- only feature. When a user needed a Shared Network or Private Gateway, they would have to make a service request to the Service Provider or infrastructure operations team. Only after that, users could configure and use their respective resources.</span></span></p><p><span><span>With Apache CloudStack 4.17, users can self-serve the creation of these resources through the UI or API with no involvement of the admin.</span></span></p><p><strong><span><span>To learn more about the remaining features introduced in the 4.17 release, read the </span><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/what-s-new-in-apache1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>release blog.</span></a></span></strong></p><p><strong><span><u><span><span>New CloudStack Integrations</span></span></u></span></strong></p><p><span><span>The community has collaborated on a new blog series named ‘CloudStack Integrations’, introducing a range of technologies with which CloudStack is integrated with and can become part of your technology stack. You will be able to learn more about different software solutions, which can be combined with CloudStack and dive deep into specialized Technical Solution Briefs presenting the integrations.</span></span></p><ul><li><span><strong>Kubernetes CAPI Provider - CloudStack Integration</strong></span></li></ul><p><span><span>The Kubernetes Cluster API (CAPI) provider for Apache CloudStack allows Kubernetes users to build and manage resources on Apache CloudStack. The Cluster API brings declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and management. The API itself is shared across multiple cloud providers allowing for true Apache CloudStack hybrid deployments of Kubernetes. It is built atop the lessons learned from previous cluster managers such as kops and kubicorn.</span></span></p><p><span><span>If users want to launch a Kubernetes cluster on Apache Cloudstack, they can check out the </span><a href="https://cluster-api-cloudstack.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Started Guide</a><span> to create your first Kubernetes cluster on Apache CloudStack using Cluster API.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Watch the session below from the CloudStack European User Group this year, featuring Peter Motykowski from AWS discuss more about the newly developed provider, its capabilities and how you can benefit from it!</span></span></p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuXdsDjPq9E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/ce27ebce-d019-41d6-b105-c2827751a678" alt="kubernetes CAPI.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><ul><li><span><a href="https://storpool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>StorPool Storage</strong></a><strong><span> – CloudStack Integration</span></strong></span></li></ul><p><span><span>StorPool Storage volume management is integrated now with Apache CloudStack to allow seamless use of the capabilities of the StorPool Storage system through the CloudStack GUI, CLI, and API interfaces. With the integration, the features available in StorPool get inherited by each cloud deployed with StorPool Storage - enabling cloned provisioning, instant snapshots, thin provisioning, and backup, disaster recovery, and Quality of Service (QoS) policies per virtual disk or virtual machine (VM). Thanks to the way StorPool works, VM provisioning is nearly instantaneous, and data placement policies and other settings can be changed in-flight to address changes in user requirements. </span><a href="/img/imported/5e069f87-a428-4f07-92ac-a8bf8d0d114b?api=v2">Click here</a><span> to download the solution brief. </span></span></p><a href="https://blogs.apache.org/cloudstack/entry/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2022-roundup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><span>CloudStack Collaboration Conference</span></strong></a><p><span><span>The community re-joined in-person for the first time since the pandemic, at the CloudStack Collaboration Conference in Sofia last month.  The hybrid event hosted over 370 participants and 48 speakers from 32 countries! The conference broke its record for the most in-person attendees. In total, there were 38 sessions from leading CloudStack experts, users and skilful engineers from the open-source world.

Just like CCC, it was great to see new CloudStack committers and users, showing the growth of the global community.  </span></span></p><p><u><span><strong><span><span>Looking to the Future - Apache CloudStack 4.18 Release</span></span></strong></span></u></p><p><span>The community is looking forward to the upcoming 4.18 release, expected in late January 2023. Some exciting features you will be able to find in the new release are: </span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong>Edge computing (4.18) </strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the data source and end consumer. The presence of computing capabilities at the edge of the network reduces response times for applications while reducing connectivity costs. </span></span></p><p><span><span>This new feature will enable</span><span> operators to leverage CloudStack in deploying light-weight Zones in edge locations. Compared to the traditional CloudStack zones, a dehydrated zone results in resource savings on the boards - solving problems related to latency at low cost in regions poorly served by the internet network.</span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong>Tungsten SDN Fabric (4.18)</strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>Tungsten Fabric is an open-source SDN project that solves tooling complexity with the simplicity of only one networking and security tool. It is maintained by The Linux Foundation and is designed to support any cloud anywhere.  </span></span></p><p><span><span>From 4.18, Apache CloudStack users can leverage Tungsten Fabric as a Network Provider in Isolated and VPC Networks, adding this widely adopted SDN fabric to fill feature gaps in CloudStack, enhancing security and capabilities.</span></span></p><ul><li><span><span><strong>Autoscaling (4.18)</strong></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>This feature is an Apache CloudStack native solution, different from other approaches that created vendor lock-in of closed source products. From Apache CloudStack 4.18, cloud users can configure Autoscale VM Groups to dynamically scale up and down the number of Instances when the defined trigger conditions are met. </span></span></p><p><span><span>… and a lot more new capabilities, which will enable cloud operators to achieve more and manage easier their virtualisation. </span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><strong><u><span><span>At the end of the year…</span></span></u></strong></span></p><p><span>It was great to see another year of expansion of the Apache CloudStack community. We are happy to see new companies around the world adopting the technology and becoming involved in the community, whether it is through collaborations, development or keeping active on the mailing lists. In order for an open-source project to develop and be successful, people need to give back to the project – something that the Apache CloudStack community does extremely well. We are very grateful to the community’s efforts and progression in the technology, so kudos to all involved!  </span></p><p><span>New use cases are being shared, such as <a href="https://www.arsat.com.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARSAT</a> covering their use cases regarding cloud services in Argentinian government entities and also sharing their mid-term roadmap strategy to include the private sector in Arsat´s client portfolio. Another thing worth reflecting on is how companies who have been adopting Apache CloudStack long-term have managed to build reliable solutions and are using the technology continuously without looking for alternatives. The reason being because CloudStack is constantly expanding its supported integrations and technologies landscape, plus the amazing pace of development and new features released. Last but not least, we also see more vendors interested in both adopting CloudStack or building new solutions on top of it like <a href="https://www.apiculus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apiculus</a> and <a href="https://www.stackbill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackBill</a> for example. </span></p><p><span>We would like to say a big thank you to everyone involved in the project and look forward to collaborating at the CloudStack European User Group in May!</span></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/apache-cloudstack-lts-release-41720">Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.17.2.0</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-12-16T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">December 16, 2022</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/73240143-71f2-48f9-b80e-650df203613d"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/73240143-71f2-48f9-b80e-650df203613d" width="100%" class="img_ev3q"></a><b># Apache CloudStack LTS Maintenance Release 4.17.2.0</b><p>The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the release of CloudStack 4.17.2.0.</p><p>The CloudStack 4.17.2.0 release is a maintenance release as part of its 4.17.x  LTS branch and contains more than 20 fixes since the CloudStack 4.17.1.0 release.</p><p>CloudStack LTS branches are supported for 18 months and will receive updates for the first 12 months and only security updates in the last 6 months.</p><p>Apache CloudStack is an integrated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) software platform that allows users to build feature-rich public and private cloud environments.

One, as enterprises are bringing their workloads ‘back’ to their premises, CloudStack is going to play a key role, as owning and managing a CloudStack setup is much more efficient (w.r.t. manpower, costs, complexity) than other orchestrators. Two, as the future is going closer and closer to the end user (Edge, Web3 etc.), the portability of CloudStack makes it an ideal candidate to embrace cloud-native and Edge-native technologies to deliver powerful orchestration capabilities nearer to the end users.”</p><p> </p><p><span><strong>Giles Sirett, CEO, </strong><a href="https://www.shapeblue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ShapeBlue</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Giles is the CEO and founder of ShapeBlue.

Most organisations are using CloudStack to drive either public cloud implementation or to orchestrate internally within an enterprise. As ShapeBlue is the company that provides services around CloudStack, we see our role as representing those customers in the open-source project. Secondary to that, we do use CloudStack in our own internal CI/CD environment, but that is a relatively small scale compared to most people using CloudStack.” </p><ul><li><strong>What is the primary benefit of using CloudStack against other virtualization management platforms?</strong></li></ul><p>“Against other IaaS orchestration platforms, CloudStack has got two key advantages: A) Ease of deployment - whereas a lot of other platforms are incredibly complex to deploy. B) Reliability – CloudStack has been around for over a decade, it’s very stable, it’s very well-known, it’s in production use at many of the world’s largest organisations.”</p><ul><li><strong>What is the future of the CloudStack project according to you? </strong></li></ul><p>“CloudStack’s scope will remain tightly defined. CloudStack does not have aspirations to become a new block storage platform or to become a container orchestrator, it’s highly defined at the level, which is the virtualised based orchestration layer. CloudStack will become increasingly reliable, increasingly easy to deploy, and effectively we hope will just become boring.”</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><span><strong>Philipp Reisner, CEO, </strong><a href="https://linbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>LINBIT</strong></a></span></p><p><strong>Philipp Reisner is one of the founders and CEO of LINBIT.

It consists of two well-concerted components. LINSTOR and DRBD. Each of them also has its independent use cases, where it is deployed alone. In this presentation, the combination of these two is examined. They form the control plane and the data plane of the SDS. We will touch on: Performance, scalability, hyper-convergence (data-locality for high IO performance), resiliency through data replication (synchronous within a site, 2-way, 3-way, or more), snapshots, backup (to S3), encryption at rest, deduplication, compression, placement policies (regarding failure domains), management CLI and webGUI, monitoring interface, self-healing (restoring redundancy after device/node failure), the federation of multiple sites (async mirroring and repeatedly snapshot difference shipping), QoS control (noisy neighbors limitation) and of course: complete integration with CloudStack for KVM guests. It is Open Source software following the Unix philosophy. Each component solves one task, made for maximal re-usability. The solution leverages the Linux kernel, LVM and/or ZFS, and many Open Source software libraries. Building on these giant Open Source foundations, not only saves LINBIT from re-inventing the wheels, it also empowers your day 2 operation teams since they are already familiar with these technologies.</div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEWjocVhzno&amp;list=PLnIKk7GjgFlYcKNbhYSgWGbJ8nJ0g496V&amp;index=22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/3a720046-c093-4636-83bb-e48f4f64da92" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 11.41.03.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/a81uXODtt3KItT" width="854" height="712" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> </iframe><div><strong>About Phillip Reisner:</strong></div><div>Philipp Reisner is one of the founders and CEO of LINBIT in Vienna/Austria.

With the help of Stack Console’s reseller management module and CloudStack, a data center or cloud service provider can build resellers/partners and provide them with an automated white-label cloud management platform so they can sell cloud services under their own brand, such as compute, Kubernetes, load balancer, block storage, and so on. Many of resellers are likely to be small and medium-sized businesses that want to get into the cloud market, so this is great news for them. Service providers will still make money whether a customer buys a service directly from them or through one of their resellers.</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_nhzY3-QZs&amp;list=PLnIKk7GjgFlYcKNbhYSgWGbJ8nJ0g496V&amp;index=24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/6b18b8d7-3faf-4f2d-87cc-2ea5686f305e" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 11.46.25.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><iframe src="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/hLfHYS9nzHSnt9" width="854" height="712" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> </iframe><div><strong>About Saurabh Rapatwar:</strong></div><div>Saurabh is a leader, an innovator, and a technology pioneer with more than 13 years of experience in the SaaS, IaaS, and technology domains.
