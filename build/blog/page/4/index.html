Apache Log4j 2.x is reported to be affected as it performs a lookup (string substitution) using the JNDI protocol, whenever the &quot;${jndi:...}&quot; string is found within a message parameter.</p><p>The Apache <a href="https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608#issuecomment-990494126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Log4j developers</a> and the <a href="http://slf4j.org/log4shell.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SLF4J project advisory</a> confirm that Apache Log4j 1.x does not offer a look-up mechanism and does not suffer remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability from CVE-2021-44228.</p><p>All Apache CloudStack releases since v4.6 use Apache Log4j version 1.2.17 and therefore are not affected by this RCE vulnerability. Most users who haven&#x27;t changed the default log4j xml config don&#x27;t need to do anything, advanced users can check and fix their log4j xml configuration if they&#x27;re using any custom JMS appenders.</p><p>The Apache CloudStack project will consider migrating to a different version of Apache Log4j in future releases.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/case-study-ikoula-xcpng-cloudstack">IKOULA Simplifies the Management of Large-Scale Cloud Infrastructure with CloudStack and XCP-ng</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-12-07T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">December 7, 2021</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/00e58d80-9b92-4974-9b5e-d06150ea0868"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/00e58d80-9b92-4974-9b5e-d06150ea0868" width="100%" alt="ikoula-xcpng-case-study-1200-628.png" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>The French specialist in web hosting, dedicated servers, and cloud computing IKOULA announced a joint case study with the leading open-source cloud management software CloudStack. For the management of their cloud environment, IKOULA decided to choose the open-source way by combining the power of CloudStack with the simplicity of the open-source hypervisor XCP-ng. Тhe turnkey combination was carefully selected following the long-term company strategy to guarantee a constant product evolution, reliability, and simplicity for their customers. As a result, IKOULA is now among the most innovative cloud and managed services providers in Europe, with an extensive portfolio of cloud solutions. Moreover, a large number of customers use their CloudStack-orchestrated infrastructure to deploy memory-oriented and storage-oriented VMs or Kubernetes clusters.</p><br><a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/30757703/CloudStack_Case-Study_IKOULA_2021-11_EN.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1638874264049&amp;api=v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY (ENGLISH)</b></a><br><a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/30757703/CloudStack_Case-Study_IKOULA_2021-11_FR.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1638874279575&amp;api=v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY (FRENCH)</b></a><br>The cloud and hosting market is one of the most competitive in the tech industry. Companies need to constantly innovate, be creative, offer exceptional service quality and support while keeping a competitive price. Choosing an open-source technology stack is a strategic decision taken by IKOULA. They eliminate all vendor lock-ins and ensure the company has full control over their infrastructure by being open-source. Other significant benefits are the easy management of extensive infrastructure, guaranteed reliability, and seamless scalability. “It is essential for us as a hosting company to know exactly what is running on our servers. This is a decisive advantage in terms of security. We decided to go with open-source solutions, as they deliver the reliability and flexibility we need. When it comes to debugging issues, we can quickly look in the code and fix it or ask the community for help on the error. CloudStack and XCP-ng have an active and growing community and constantly evolving products, which is a huge benefit”, <b>said Joaquim Dos Santos, R&amp;D Director at Ikoula</b>. CloudStack and XCP-ng also give a financial advantage to IKOULA, which is extremely important in their market segment. According to their team, operating XCP-ng and CloudStack results in greatly reduced costs than other solutions. They have also greatly reduced their reliance on 3rd parties to help maintain their environment.<p>At this stage, IKOULA manages a large CloudStack environment with 100+ hosts in 8 different zones and 6600+ customers using it. They can make live updates and upgrades of the system without any service interruptions for the end-users. Among the most valuable CloudStack features for them are the multi-tenancy of the solution, its scalability and the power to easily manage hundreds of hosts and thousands of VMs.</p><br><a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/30757703/CloudStack_Case-Study_IKOULA_2021-11_EN.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1638874264049&amp;api=v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY (ENGLISH)</b></a><br><a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/30757703/CloudStack_Case-Study_IKOULA_2021-11_FR.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1638874279575&amp;api=v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>DOWNLOAD THE CASE STUDY (FRENCH)</b></a><br><b>About IKOULA</b><p>Pioneer of the French Cloud since 1998, IKOULA has its own Datacenters in France, as well as two subsidiaries, in Spain and in the Netherlands.

This integration is available for PowerFlex versions 4.3 onwards and only for the KVM hypervisor at this stage.  </p></div><br><div><b>LINBIT and CloudStack Integration</b><a href="/img/imported/8c768dc5-210a-41fc-911b-0f2f2f7c7453"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/8c768dc5-210a-41fc-911b-0f2f2f7c7453?t=true" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Support has also been added for Linstor storage. The plugin, again, allows CloudStack to manage Linstor volumes for primary storage and also supports snapshots. </p><p>LINBIT SDS is deeply integrated with Apache Cloudstack. It has a native driver in the OS which provides block devices to the KVM. The CloudStack integration helps administrators to manage storage functions like snapshots, migration with the API.</p></div><div><b>Enhancements to CloudStack Kubernetes Service</b><a href="/img/imported/a407189f-02c6-4c71-ae99-bf0f99783fdf"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/a407189f-02c6-4c71-ae99-bf0f99783fdf?t=true" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>CloudStack Kubernetes Service (CKS)  first shipped in CloudStack 4.14 and provides full Kubernetes integration to CloudStack – allowing users to run containerized services using Kubernetes clusters without the pain of having to deploy Kubernetes clusters themselves </p><p>CloudStack 4.16 brings a number of improvements to CKS. Kubernetes autoscaling is now supported through the creation of a Kubernetes provider for CloudStack. This means that Kubernetes will be able to scale up a cluster if pods cannot be scheduled and then scale it back down. </p><p>The base template for Kubernetes clusters in CloudStack has now been unified with the existing System VM Template, removing the dependency on CoreOS and simplifying ongoing maintenance.  </p></div><h2>UI Improvements</h2>The previous release saw a new, improved user interface experience for Apache CloudStack  – for both users and administrators. 4.16 sees many new features in that interface, all designed to make interactions with CloudStack easier.<p>It is now possible to select multiple objects (i.e. Instances, volumes, etc) and perform actions against that bulk selection. For example, if you wish to restart 10 instances or lock 5 accounts, these types of actions can easily be done with a single click.  </p><a href="/img/imported/7dd821bd-4237-4ac8-88d9-657f97e01429"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/7dd821bd-4237-4ac8-88d9-657f97e01429" width="50%" alt="416-zone_card_view.png" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>The UI has become much more visual with the addition of configurable icons for most types of resources. For example, zones can now be represented by geographical flags or instances by their OS type. Users can even upload a profile picture of themselves. </p><p>These icons can be configured at the administrator level and also overridden by individual users. </p><p>Users can also now make comments or notes against most resource types.  This can be used for making simple configuration notes or even as a full changelog against an object. This is available for most resource types including Instances, domains, hosts, SSH keypairs, volumes, snapshots, etc </p><p>A full audit log of comments is maintained, including the date stamp and the user who made the comment. Administrators are able to create and remove comments from any object and can see all the comments on every object. Permissions are applied to domain administrators and users, allowing them to comment, remove and see comments only on the entities they have access to. </p><p>There is also a new “Comments” section under the main menu, allowing users to see all of their comments across all objects and types.  </p><a href="/img/imported/e40e8bff-146e-445c-ace9-f48130b1f977"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/e40e8bff-146e-445c-ace9-f48130b1f977" width="50%" alt="416-comments.png" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>The final UI improvement is a big time saver. Users can now submit any form by pressing CTRL Enter.</p><h2>Upgrade Improvements</h2><p>The last few versions of CloudStack have all seen major improvements to the upgrade process, with the overall goal of “zero downtime upgrades” getting ever closer. </p><p>4.16 sees this work continue: the requirement to manually register the system VM Template before an upgrade has now been removed. Template registration is now automated as part of the package upgrade process. </p><p>The database upgrade process has also been refined and can be run without needing the root user credentials.</p><h2>Improved Tools &amp; Management</h2><p>The ability to import and export existing Virtual machines as CloudStack instances is an area that has seen a lot of focus in recent versions. 4.16 sees new functionality in the UI that allows admins to take existing VMWare instances for a VMWare cluster and quickly put them under CloudStack management (or to “unmanage” them in reverse).

He started his journey with CloudStack when he was still a student in the university, became fast a contributor, PMC member and now he is VP of the project.</p><p>Gabriel is a quite interesting person – born and living in Brazil, but working for a Dutch company, he seems to be an international person. On the technology side, he is an experienced Java developer and has a deep knowledge in a range of other technology. On the personal side, Gabriel is excited to help CloudStack grow as a community and spread the knowledge for it as much a possible.</p><p>eet Gabriel – the new VP of Apache CloudStack. A person, who is friendly, open-minded and ready to help everyone in the community!</p><a href="/img/imported/6d6dbf9f-d964-496f-82af-a4c764e5f865"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/6d6dbf9f-d964-496f-82af-a4c764e5f865?t=true" alt="Gabriel-VPACS.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></a><b>1. What exactly is the role of VP of Apache CloudStack?</b><p>To give some context let’s start with a bit of Apache.</p><p>The Apache Software Foundation controls over 300+ Projects. Therefore, it is quite hard for a single Apache Board to stay close and manage all the projects.</p><p>With that in mind, each project holds a group of contributors capable of managing supervising the project following the Apache guidelines; this group is called Project Management Committee (PMC). A project VP is a PMC Chair appointed by the Apache Board.</p><p>The VP serves as a bridge between the ASF Board and the Project, providing reports to the Apache Board on a quarterly basis. VP also holds an important role in terms of marketing the project and orchestrating discussions.</p><br><b>2. If you look at CloudStack, it has played a critical role for many solutions providers and companies who search for ease of use and deployment. Which companies can benefit the most from CloudStack?</b><p>Any company that deploys and consumes large loads of computer resources can benefit from CloudStack. Some examples are:</p><p>· Cloud Providers: they are a perfect match as their core business is Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)</p><p>· Telecommunications Companies: are transiting to large cloud infrastructures; especially with the wide change on the communication industry (migrating from traditional Telephone &amp; TV to wireless mobile and Internet technologies)</p><p>· Universities and Research Rroups: need large scale systems for running experiments and also maintaining multiple services for students, professors, and researchers</p><p>· Enterprises / Governmental Organizations: they process and store loads of data, and need elastic computer resources to comply with their demands</p><p>In summary, these companies have something in common:</p><ol><li><p>The costs with public clouds are higher than deploying and managing their own Private Cloud.</p></li><li><p>Also, some companies must control their data and will not process them on third-parties.</p></li></ol><p>In all those cases CloudStack has proven to be a competitive option.</p><br><b>3. Choosing a cloud management system is a hard thing, especially if you have a long history with specific technologies. Why should companies migrate to CloudStack?</b><p>That is true. Choosing such a system is hard and it requires evaluating many aspects, such as the goals, expectations, and technical background that the company already has.</p><p>CloudStack can handle a wide set of hypervisors, and instead of creating new components and projects, it focuses on connecting and managing solid technologies such as iSCSI, NFS, and Ceph. Additionally, it allows configuring guest networks with IPv6 protocol for VMs, which is not commonly supported by other cloud orchestration systems.</p><p>In short: a good thing from CloudStack for companies planning to migrate to Private Cloud is that it adopted technologies that are out in the industry for decades and most of the Admins and Engineers are already used to them. This can cut deployment and operation costs.</p><br><b>4. On the development side, how easy it is to implement and manage CloudStack?</b><p>CloudStack, as any other cloud orchestration platform, is a complex solution; it requires IT professionals with multidisciplinary backgrounds, such as development skills (e.g. Java, Python, MySQL, Bash, Git, Node.js), as well as experience with virtualization, networking and storage systems. So it might take some time for a new developer to learn its way. However, Apache projects work hard to help newcomers; and CloudStack is no different. There are documentations that guide users, system admins, and developers. Deploying CloudStack can be easy when compared to other options and operating it can be simple to users that are well adapted with all the technologies in CloudStack.</p><br><b>5. What would you share about the community?</b><p>The fact that the project is managed by Apache Software Foundation provides all the Apache background on building an open-source community. It is one of our core goals to encourage experienced developers and users to help newcomers.</p><p>On top of that, assembling a community where everyone has a saying is one of the foundations of Apache projects. Therefore, we are always open to new ideas and feature requests.</p><br><b>6. How do you think we can all grow the CloudStack community?</b><p>It is very important to grow our community and I strongly believe that we should connect to students, researchers and professors in a way that we can bring young and passionate talents to develop our project.</p><p>Additionally, participating in conferences and writing for technical magazines can advertise Cloud computing Infrastructure-as-a-Service model as well as the CloudStack project.</p><br><b>7. What is the direction in which CloudStack is going as a technology?</b><p>We are working hard to keep it a reliable and stable solution; but it is also key to invest on user-friendly experience. A good project is one that can be easily deployed and used. We have been continuously enhancing the documentation; additionally, CloudStack has recently migrated to a new User Interface.</p><br><b>8. Many community members notice that CloudStack is becoming more and more appealing for enterprises. What would you advise this type of organisations?</b><p>Small-medium enterprises need to determine which deployment model best suits their Cloud strategy. There are pros and cons on any of the cloud options (private, public, or hybrid clouds).</p><p>Considering the complexity and challenges of deploying a cloud infrastructure, Cloudstack is reliable, easy to deploy, and can scale well. Additionally, CloudStack supports integration with public clouds; therefore it is a great option for hybrid clouds.</p><p>We have many known cases of companies that use it for a long time and have scaled their CloudStack Data Centers to huge amounts of Hosts and VMs. But there are also examples of small organizations that are benefiting from private clouds either as a key component of their core business or a tool for internal IT development and growth.</p><br><b>9. As a person, you are recognized for your contribution to CloudStack. How did you start with it?</b><p>It all started in 2013, when I was an undergrad student working at a research lab that wanted to deploy a Cloud orchestration platform. We chose CloudStack over all the options and I began my journey on the CloudStack world.</p><p>On the 1st November 2013 I sent my first mail to the CloudStack mailing list with some questions regarding the process of upgrading from CloudStack 4.1.1 to 4.2.0.</p><p>In December of 2015 I opened my first Pull Request, which led me to work closer to the community by interacting at the mailing lists, and proposing and reviewing implementations.</p><p>I became a committer in 2017 and worked as a Release Manager for CloudStack 4.12.0.0 in early 2018. By the end of 2018 I was invited to be part of the Apache CloudStack PMC.</p><br><b>10. Any advice to all developers, writing new features for CloudStack?</b><p>Open source is all about multiple developers creating and fixing code together; we must focus on maintainability, stability, and documentation.</p><p>When writing new features we should think about how other developers will debug and extend the code. In summary: write code as simple as possible.</p><p>I would recommend the following principles:</p><ol><li><p>Use clear and self-explaining variable names</p></li><li><p>Take advantage of coding libraries to use existing tools</p></li><li><p>Make it easy for other developers to work into the workflow</p></li><li><p>Keep it well documented</p></li><li><p>Make code reusable and avoid duplicated lines</p><br></li></ol><b>11. If you need to summarize CloudStack in 3 words, what would they be?</b><p>Open-source reliable clouds, or simply: it goes on!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/page/3"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer Entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/5"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/getting-started">Getting started</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/supported-commands">Supported commands</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://join.slack.com/t/cloudstackcommunity/shared_invite/zt-p5928e3r-OUAK8SUgC8GOceGM6dAz6w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Slack<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Issue Tracker<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Source Repo<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-www" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Website Source Repo<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://cloudstack.apache.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footerLogoLink_BH7S"><img src="/img/banner.svg" alt="Apache CloudStack logo" class="themedImage_ToTc themedImage--light_HNdA footer__logo"><img src="/img/banner.svg" alt="Apache CloudStack logo" class="themedImage_ToTc themedImage--dark_i4oU footer__logo"></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><div style="text-align: left;">
