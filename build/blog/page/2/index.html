2022-07-18 at 15.33.00.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Apache CloudStack version 4.5.0 and later has a SAML 2.0 authentication Service Provider plugin which is found to be vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injection. This plugin is not enabled by default and the attacker would require that this plugin be enabled to exploit the vulnerability. When the SAML 2.0 plugin is enabled in affected versions of Apache CloudStack could potentially allow the exploitation of XXE vulnerabilities. The SAML 2.0 messages constructed during the authentication flow in Apache CloudStack are XML-based and the XML data is parsed by various standard libraries that are now understood to be vulnerable to XXE injection attacks such as arbitrary file reading, possible denial of service, server-side request forgery (SSRF) on the CloudStack management server.</p><p>As of 18th July 2022, this is now tracked under CVE-2022-35741: <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35741</a></p><p>To mitigate the risk, a CloudStack admin can do any of the following:</p><p>1. Disable the SAML 2.0 plugin by setting `saml2.enabled` to false and restart the management servers.</p><p>2. Upgrade to Apache CloudStack 4.16.1.1 or 4.17.0.1 or higher.</p><p><b>Credit</b>This issue was discovered and reported by &quot;v3ged0ge&quot;.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/meet-the-community-k-b">Meet the Community - K B Shiv Kumar </a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-06-20T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">June 20, 2022</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/c0ca3334-ec0f-4dc4-80a3-b97372f44973"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/c0ca3334-ec0f-4dc4-80a3-b97372f44973" alt="Screenshot 2022-06-21 at 10.35.49.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p><strong>Introduce yourself with a few words</strong></p><p>I am K B Shiv Kumar and am the Co-Founder and CTO at IndiQus. I am based out of Delhi, India and am passionate about travelling and dig going on driving holidays with my friends and family. I love listening to music and ABBA has been my all-time favourite band since childhood.</p><p><strong>Tell us your story in one Tweet?</strong></p><p>As a commerce graduate, moving to an IT career accidentally was probably the best thing that happened to me. I subsequently completed my masters in software engineering and worked as a developer with different ISPs where my interest in infrastructure programming was kindled.</p><p><strong>When did you start your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>My first exposure to CloudStack was in 2013 and since then I have embarked on a very exciting journey where I have evolved from a CloudStack user to an evangelist. I love tinkering on CloudStack and the techno-commercial possibilities it offers to the regional Internet, Cloud and Data Center providers.</p><p><strong>Who was your mentor during your CloudStack journey?</strong></p><p>I have received a lot of help from the community. If I must take a single name, it would be Rohit Yadav. He has been my mentor and will probably remain so for a while as far as CloudStack is concerned. During my initial days, folks from Citrix helped me a lot too, Vimmy Hong for one.</p><p><strong>Which was the latest feature on which you contributed or what was your last commitment to the CloudStack project?</strong></p><p>My commitment to CloudStack has been indirect but impacting. It has been taking it to the industry – the enterprises, telecoms, ISPs and data centre providers and showcasing how CloudStack can be leveraged as a viable cloud business model and implementing the same across various geographies. My organisation’s product offering is completely architected by leveraging CloudStack and transforming it into a techno-commercial solution.</p><p>On the technical side, I have worked extensively on various aspects of monitoring CloudStack and shared the same amongst the community. I am currently looking to implement an outside-in way of monitoring VRs and providing auto-scale facilities without modifying the CloudStack code.</p><p><strong>Why do people need to choose open-source technology?</strong></p><p>It’s cost-effective, allows unmatched customising flexibility and it works! It’s that simple. Since it’s community-driven, it is always balanced.

Apache CloudStack 4.17 is an LTS (Long Term Support) release so will be maintained for a period of 18 months after release.</p><p>As always, the release contains a myriad of small improvements and bug fixes but here we focus on the major new functionality of the release.</p><p><strong>VR Zero Downtime upgrades and Live Patching</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/bc49a766-6b83-4e9c-b4f9-a233a176699f"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/bc49a766-6b83-4e9c-b4f9-a233a176699f" alt="0.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>This is one of the most anticipated improvements by existing Apache CloudStack operators. CloudStack has always been easier to upgrade than many of its competitors but has required its virtual routers to be redeployed during an upgrade.</p><p><strong>o Zero Downtime Upgrades for Virtual Routers</strong><br>With this new feature, the virtual router does not have to go through the process of complete removal and instantiating a new one involving shutdown, resource release, system VM template copy from secondary storage to primary, starting and VR configuration<br>Previously when a new release of Apache CloudStack was deployed, the operations team had to organize maintenance windows to allow the redeployment of every virtual router. Now an in-place upgrade of CloudStack virtual routers can be performed with zero downtime.<br></p><p><strong>o VR Live Patching</strong><br>Underpinning zero downtime upgrades is the new feature VR live patching. This feature can also be used independently of upgrades and allow CloudStack admins to apply software updates to Virtual Routers on the fly. Previously all Apache CloudStack scripts to manage the Virtual Router were stored in an ISO image and mounted during the first boot and then copied to the Virtual Router. Now the update is performed dynamically , as long as the base OS remains constant , users to not need to recreate the Virtual Router.</p><p><strong>IPv6 support for Isolated and VPC Networks</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/919e55f8-b723-4680-b538-f9afc2ce0e01"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/919e55f8-b723-4680-b538-f9afc2ce0e01" alt="2.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>IPv6 is considered a natural evolution of any system that intends to be present in computing environments in the future. The RIPE NCC, which assigns IP addresses in 76 countries to ISPs and other organizations, got its final allocation of IPv4 addresses from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) in 2012.<br>Apache CloudStack already supported IPv6 for Shared Networks; now IPv6 is also supported for Isolated Networks and VPC. Users can deploy IPv6 networks where routing is currently static, allowing users to use subnets of IPv6 networks directly in CloudStack instances.<br>In this context, unlike IPv4 that relies on NAT to deliver network services to users, the Virtual Router behaves like a real router, routing IPv6 packets and allowing users to configure firewall.</p><p><strong>StorPool Storage Plugin</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/c15f95e5-3b77-4bc5-b518-dc42ca867041"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/c15f95e5-3b77-4bc5-b518-dc42ca867041" alt="3.png" width="710" height="456" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>StorPool is a software defined storage platform in use by many CloudStack operators globally. StorPool has had “managed storage” integration with CloudStack for some time but now the StorPool Storage plug-in is natively included with Apache CloudStack. Thanks to the built-in automation of the plug-in, cloud builders can seamlessly manage their cloud from CloudStack’s familiar user interfaces, and all storage-related operations are transparently passed down to the underlying StorPool primary storage system.</p><p>With the Storpool plug-in, the features available in StorPool get inherited by each cloud-deployed - enabling cloned provisioning, instant snapshots, thin provisioning, backup/DR and QoS policies per virtual disk and/or per Instance. Instance provisioning is nearly instantaneous and data placement policies and other settings can be changed in-flight to address changes in user requirements.</p><p><strong>Self-service Network Improvements</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/417bd9d1-ba39-4904-b56b-bcf226dab4ff"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/417bd9d1-ba39-4904-b56b-bcf226dab4ff" alt="4.png" width="668" height="575" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Previously, the creation of Shared Networks and Private Gateways was an admin- only feature. When a user needed a Shared Network or Private Gateway, they would have to make a service request to the Service Provider or infrastructure operations team. Only after that, users could configure and use their respective resources.</p><p>With Apache CloudStack 4.17, users can self-serve the creation of these resources through the UI or API with no involvement of the admin.</p><p><strong>Multi-account Network Access</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/6c540c73-9951-4cb7-8a4c-7fdf1b25a000"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/6c540c73-9951-4cb7-8a4c-7fdf1b25a000" alt="5.png" width="750" height="242" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>In Apache CloudStack, users are organized into a logical structure of Accounts and Domains. In previous version of Apache CloudStack, the resources of each Account weren’t shared, and each Account had its own resources. As an example, sometimes​​​​​​ a particular software application from a specific Account needed to access an application in another account under the same Domain. For this to be feasible, users configured their networks with the firewall rules, port forwarding, load balancing or private gateway to allow this type of use case. In addition, this configuration caused a lot of network overhead as all packets had to go through 2 different Virtual Routers to reach their destination.</p><p>With Apache CloudStack 4.17, users can connect their instances by adding a new network interface from an Account under the same Domain, simplifying this kind of use case. Furthermore, if the communication between instances occurs only at OSI layer 2, several overheads are removed, considering that the I/O packets will be established between the instances directly in the same network layer to which they are connected.</p><p><strong>Multiple SSH Keys</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/6242bd8e-d5ad-4027-aed4-3dd576a58199"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/6242bd8e-d5ad-4027-aed4-3dd576a58199" alt="6.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>CloudStack users can now create Instances and include multiple SSH Keys. This avoids the need to share private keys between users that access the Instance.</p><p>Previously, if users needed to add more SSH Keys to access the instance, it was necessary to connect to the instance and then edit the .ssh/authorized_keys file, however now all the keys needed can be selected during the instance creation itself.</p><p><strong>Structured System Events</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/69265134-a914-48d2-8af0-70cb5d8d0828"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/69265134-a914-48d2-8af0-70cb5d8d0828" alt="Untitled design.png" width="750" height="647" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 brings much more structure to its system Events. Auditability and traceability of operations performed are important requirements for most organisations.</p><p>CloudStack Events are the primary data-source for auditing and troubleshooting a CloudStack environment. Events have now been improved by being explicitly linking to the resource that the event concerns. This allows Events to be searched, filtered and sorted by object.</p><p>Navigation is also improved, allowing users to navigate easily to the events for a specific object i.e. Instance, Network, Host</p><p>Many CloudStack operators had previously parsed the Event messages to store them in a 3rd party data source. The messages remain unchanged to allow backwards compatibility of such integrations.</p><p><strong>Snapshot improvements</strong></p><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 introduces storage-based snapshots - an alternative for taking snapshots of virtual machines running under the KVM hypervisor. The current implementation uses libvirt to perform the snapshot and doesn’t allow storage providers that keep VM virtual disks in RAW format (e.g., Ceph/NetApp SolidFire/LINSTOR/StorPool Storage) to take VM snapshots.</p><p>The storage-based snapshots feature provides for such storage systems the functionality to take crash-consistent snapshots of any VM’s virtual disks without the memory. The feature relies on each underlying storage plug-in’s capability to create/revert/delete virtual disk snapshots.</p><p><strong>Instance and Volumes migration improvements</strong></p><p>Apache CloudStack allows admins to migrate Instances and volumes using a wizard. Previously this wizard would automatically allocate Primary Storage for Instance Volumes based solely on storage tags. CloudStack 4.17 now allows the admin to explicitly allocate each Instance Volume to different specific Primary Storages.</p><p>In addition, to make more informed decisions while selecting destination host and storage, additional information is presented in the UI such as the occupancy of existing capacity of these resources, which brings a significant improvement in migration functionality.</p><p><strong>More flexible service offerings</strong></p><a href="/img/imported/7d34a18b-a0d9-4da5-8ffe-bfb66496aaf3"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/7d34a18b-a0d9-4da5-8ffe-bfb66496aaf3" alt="9.png" width="750" height="596" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 redefines the relationship between the Service Offerings used for Instance Root Disks and the Service Offering for the Instance itself.</p><p>Instance Root Volumes were previously handled decoupled from Disk Offerings: a change of the Root Volume characteristics wasn’t possible due to this logical disconnection. Thus, users couldn’t, for example, change to a Disk Offering that guaranteed higher I/O needs if necessary. So, there were two types of resources, Root volume and Data volume, but the treatment used in both was not unified.</p><p>The existing model is still fully supported if required, but this improvement gives operators far greater flexibility when it comes to the provisioning and billing for root volumes.</p><p><strong>Server Status Report</strong>Apache CloudStack 4.17 now gives admins the ability to see the status/health of their Management Servers, the Usage Server, and the underlying database server (and their respective individual components). This feature is available in the UI and API for integration/monitoring purposes.</p><p><strong>KVM multiple local storage</strong></p><p>Apache CloudStack 4.17 now supports multiple local storage volumes for KVM based Hosts. Previously, for KVM hosts, it was only possible to have one primary local storage, which prevented providers from adding extra disks to be offered on CloudStack.</p><p>With this improvement, if more than one local disk on the KVM host is available, it is possible to designate them to be offered as a local disk offering , thus enabling a better use of allocated resources.</p><p><strong>Reserve and release Public IPs</strong>Users can now reserve public IPs for later use on their networks. This new functionality makes managing this feature easier, as users often need to have IP information available beforehand to parameterize DNS records, for example.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/cloudstack-collaboration-conference-2022-november">CloudStack Collaboration Conference 2022 - November 14-16</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-05-26T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 26, 2022</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="/img/imported/c8eec338-5d20-4e46-80d3-376294e441f0"><img loading="lazy" src="/img/imported/c8eec338-5d20-4e46-80d3-376294e441f0" alt="Screenshot 2022-05-26 at 15.49.12.png" width="750" height="393" class="img_ev3q"></a><p>For the 10<sup>th</sup> consecutive year, the Apache CloudStack community is organising its major event - CloudStack Collaboration Conference, running from 14<sup>th</sup> to 16<sup>th</sup> November 2022.

Simon has been an Apache CloudStack PMC member for the last few years. He has a strong technology background in multiple competencies, including networking and systems. In addition to it, he has a significant business development background with both start-ups and established organizations and is a highly experienced strategic thinker and relationship builder.</p><p>Currently, Simon Weller is the Vice President Of Technology of Education Networks of America. He is responsible for the technology initiatives at ENA across the Systems, R&amp;D, Internal Systems and Data Architecture and Business Intelligence teams. Simon is also heavily involved in product development and business development.</p><p>Ivet Petrova, Marketing Director at ShapeBlue interviewed Simon as part of the Meet the Community Series. You can watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sVYGehxsn0&amp;t=332s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Below, you can find some of the key point’s Simon laid out in the video.</p><p><strong>Тhe </strong><strong>Evolution of Apache CloudStack: </strong><strong>Continue the community vision and drive forward</strong></p><p>‘I think that every project that gets accepted under the Apache umbrella always has to try and build that really important base of community, because without that community, you can&#x27;t survive. We see a lot of projects that have got a lot of excitement and they just fade away. I think what&#x27;s been really great about CloudStack over the years is that we&#x27;ve managed to really continue that community vision and we&#x27;ve got a really great core group of people that have been around a long time that still have that passion and want to encourage others to participate as well. But the most important thing of open source is, you have to get others to want to contribute and you have to get others to want to give up some of their time and effort in order to make sure that you don&#x27;t just survive, but that you can actually drive forward a project into the future and make it sustainable.’</p><p><strong>The Everyday Problems Open-source Solutions Solve: Building a Long-term sustainability</strong></p><p>‘Part of what I&#x27;ve done since I started in technology has always been trying to leverage the best technology and the best open-source solutions that we can. But I think one thing that is often missed by a lot of enterprise environments and organisations is that they think that they can just take and just walk away. But the most important thing to sustainability long term is you have to be able to give back as well. So, part of what my mission has always been working at open source for a long time, is making sure that when we do talk to others and we encourage them to try the technology out and hopefully implement it into production, but also think about how are they going to give back long term so that the product and the project is sustainable.’</p><p><strong>The Secret of a Successful Open-source Community: Engagement in all areas</strong></p><p>‘I think it&#x27;s a bit of a misnomer that a lot of people have that you have to be a developer in order to be able to give back to open-source. So, I&#x27;m not a great developer, I dabble a little bit, but I&#x27;m not going to claim that I&#x27;m the best developer suited for any particular environmental project. Where I come in personally is I really try and give back to the user base from an engineering perspective. You&#x27;ve got a problem -how do we help you fix it? You want to implement a potential way of doing things - how can we encourage others to collaborate on it together? So, I think that a lot of people need to get out of that mindset, that you&#x27;ve got to be a coder in order to be able to give back to open source. There are so many other areas that you can contribute. I mean, case in point Ivet, you&#x27;re fantastic at what you do, but you&#x27;re not a developer, right? But you are encouraging others through your engagement practises, through organising events, through promoting the project overall to the community. And that is just as important, if not more so than ever writing a line of code. So I think that a lot of people need to start to maybe think about other areas that they can contribute outside of just writing a line of code, because a project doesn&#x27;t survive long term unless you have that marketing capability, unless you have the outreach and you&#x27;re able to encourage new participants because ultimately you&#x27;re always going to have some people leaving the community and you need a long, robust pipeline of new members coming in to help out as well.’</p><p><strong>Implementing CloudStack: Scalability, simplicity and reliability</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>‘I think that what draws a lot of people to CloudStack is the fact that it supports a lot of different technologies. And a lot of companies at some point get to a realisation that they have to scale their environment. And doing that with a lot of the other products on the market with a commercial open source can be quite challenging. And case in point, we&#x27;ve seen a lot of folks over the years that have started off with VMware or they might have started off with a public cloud solution like AWS or Azure or Google Cloud. They get to a point and then they figure out, well, how are we going to scale this? And let me explain what I mean by that, because a lot of people right now are saying, well, of course, you can scale AWS or Azure or Google Cloud, you can, but at a massive cost. So, scaling comes in to both how to make money long term if you&#x27;re a commercial entity. And how to minimise those costs, how do you make it more manageable and how do you get to that next level? So, I think a lot of entities that start looking at that solution, such as Apache CloudStack, I think in not just about the pure technology play, but their thinking about the viability of the product long-term. Typically, what we see is that as new companies get started, or even established companies get started, they see a higher margin opportunity on the front end, and over time that starts to get a bit more commoditized. They&#x27;re looking for areas of savings in the underlying technology, and I think that&#x27;s where a lot of people start to look at CloudStack. I think also you see other people and other companies that have been at open-source for a long time. And they might have deployed KVM or some other hypervisor technology. And they just get to that technological point where they can no longer scale managing manually 100 hosts or something like that. And so, they start to look for orchestration methods to make their life easier. And that&#x27;s really where CloudStack shines.’</p><p><strong>The Benefits of Open-source Technology: Much more than cost-savings</strong></p><p>‘The number one thing that I always think about is flexibility. And the ability for you to take something that has already been built out and then add new capabilities to it, to meet the mission of your organisation&#x27;s goals. For example, we&#x27;ve contributed a lot of new features to CloudStack over the years that have been driven by customer demands. And that&#x27;s the best way to build a business, as you build stuff that customers want to buy. So, I think by utilising open source in general or CloudStack or any open-source tooling, it allows you to take a great set of features and functionality that will scale and then add your own secret sauce to it. Or as we often do, give back that secret sauce to the community so they can get a benefit from it as well.’</p><p><strong>Apache CloudStack: When and how it fits? </strong></p><p><strong> </strong>‘I&#x27;d like to say that it can suit everyone, but I think that&#x27;s probably not entirely true. I think that you have to have some level of expertise on your team in order to be able to support it long term. And that doesn&#x27;t mean that you need to have a massive team. The fact that could be a team one, but it does take, as with any software platform in any project, it does take expertise in order to operate at long term. So, what I would say is, is that if you were thinking about deploying Apache CloudStack and you already have a few Linux chops under your belt, then that&#x27;s probably more than enough for you to be able to explore and deploy. CloudStack is extraordinarily easy to deploy. We love to say that it just works. And that&#x27;s a true statement. But if something starts to go south, if something starts to go wrong, you&#x27;re going to have to start digging in a little better to the underpinnings of how the infrastructure works. Because you have to remember that CloudStack is effectively an orchestrator. It&#x27;s managing other components. So those other components can go south, but CloudStack could be fine, right? So, it&#x27;s important that you have a good understanding of how the ecosystem of various underpinnings of CloudStack functions so that you are more empowered to address problems if they do arise.’</p><p><strong>The Path of Constant Improvement</strong><strong>: </strong><strong>From IaaS to building PaaS products on top of Apache CloudStack</strong></p><p>‘I think the community is always looking for new ways to improve. No software platform is perfect, right? If it is, then we could just go home, open a bottle of wine, and everything would be great. To be realistic about it, there’s always new features. And the market is evolving at such a rapid pace these days that a lot of organisations are looking for new ways to be able to consume a service or consume a product. And I think that from CloudStack’s perspective, we&#x27;ve been very deliberate about where we plan, where we don&#x27;t play. So, CloudStack has typically always been an infrastructure as a service orchestrator play. And there are other folks out there that are taking that as the underpinnings and building various platform as a service on top. So, I think there&#x27;s always areas that we can improve and new features that we could add that are more underpinnings. But I think that one thing that we&#x27;ve always done really good at as a community is knowing where we play and where we don&#x27;t play, because in the end it&#x27;s fine to contribute a massive new feature, but if no one&#x27;s going to support it long term, then it&#x27;s very difficult to get others to come in and number one, help out with that and to be able to promote it.’</p><p><strong>Building a Stable Roadmap Inside an Open-source Community</strong></p><p>‘It often depends on open source of how the oversight is run. So, in some open-source projects, someone has decided that they want to open source and software and they put it up on GitHub and they are effectively God. They can do whatever they want. Whether other people support them or not is effectively irrelevant in that picture. But when you&#x27;ve got a large product or service that is inside a more structured entity such as Apache, we have a lot of guidance on how a community should interact. And I think honestly, that is very healthy because we really want others to contribute ideas. We need to have a robust discussion around things. And sometimes that robust discussion can be a bit difficult for certain people. But it is it is crucial that we get by from the community in order to chart the right path. So, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a typical product management style roadmap that we see in open source, but it is very important that as ideas are brought to the table, they are discussed and that others are willing to support the overall vision so that we do go in the right direction. I think the other component too and we see this quite a lot in CloudStack is, we have commercial entities out there that are providing support and development services. Good examples of that is ShapeBlue and CloudOps and others. And they have customers that might say, you know what? We want you to develop this new feature for CloudStack, and then they agree to open source it and give it back to the community. So that&#x27;s also a great way to continue to feature development because those features are often very commercially driven. And considering we are obviously predominantly used by those that commercially driven, those features can be easy to adopt by others as well.’</p><p><strong>Release Management: Rapid Development of New Features and Capabilities</strong></p><p>‘We try and keep the release cadence pretty consistent overall. We have major releases and we have minor dot releases that are really focussed very much on critical bug fixes because in the end, the operator&#x27;s utilising CloudStack expect stability. And so, we have to be quite deliberate about what we will allow and what we won&#x27;t allow. So typically, when we&#x27;re talking about a major release such as 4.16 or the future for 4.17, we are talking about new features that could be breaking changes. Potentially, we&#x27;ll have high risk associated with them. If we&#x27;re talking about 4.16.1, then we&#x27;re talking about very, very minor changes that are totally focussed on stability and bug fixes. In terms of how we decide what features are going to new major release milestones, that&#x27;s really got a lot to do with what has been reviewed and what the overall community is comfortable with. So, if an organisation or a developer brings in a new feature, they will open a pull request and they will request that to be merged and they will request review of that pull request via members of the community. And the members of the community will then make suggestions, or they might say, you know what, this is a cool feature, but we think it might break something else. And so, we would work with that contributor to figure out maybe how to re-implement that. But a very important part of CloudStack is stability. So, we always smoke test all of the new features that come in because we want to make sure that we are providing that long term stability that our users expect.’</p><p><strong>Becoming Part of Apache CloudStack: An advice for developers</strong></p><p>‘CloudStack is a huge project. I mean, the amount of code at times is a bit mind boggling. And I think the number one thing that I would recommend to someone who wants to get into development is become part of the mailing lists. You know, we have great development mailing lists, we have great user mailing lists and get a test environment set up, start to play with it, start to understand the features, how the features work in your environment, and then start to explore the code. And don&#x27;t be scared of asking questions. You know, we have a great group of people who are really, really willing to help. And I, for one, want to make sure that anyone who comes to the community is going to get a benefit of being able to hopefully avoid the pain and suffering that some of us have gone through trying to figure out how certain things work. If you’re trying to implement something in a particular driver, I guarantee there’s someone that has already suffered that pain before. So just asking on the mailing list, we can find that right person for you and they can hopefully help shortcut that learning curve. And the events are fantastic. During the COVID era which has obviously been challenging for all of us, we have had some of our biggest online events. Ivet you have produced and made them super successful which is fantastic. And so, it’s just great seeing all these new people come out of the woodwork who are willing to learn and willing to become part of the community.’</p><p><strong>The Targets of the VP: Simon’s vision for the CloudStack development</strong></p><p>‘I’m very lucky that the PMC’s voted for me to be in this role and I just want to thank them for the support. Really, I just am going to be continuing on from the trailblazing people before me. We’ve had a great group of others that have been in the VP position over the last decade. And I think the number one thing that every single person in this role wants, is to help drive forward the vision in the community around Apache CloudStack. So, that’s really what I want to help do, I want to continue to talk to as many people as possible and hopefully encourage them to be part of the community so that we can continue to see the widescale success that we’re known for. And I think part of getting out there and promoting the overall project is the desire to have more users. Because in the end we need that strong user base to not just survive, but to thrive. And there’s always going to be a new use case that someone figures out. I think what we are starting to see more and more in the enterprise community right now is that public cloud is always going to be there. And I think that as some larger enterprises start to look at their costs associated with that, their starting to look a little bit more wider field of what the other options might be. So, we’re seeing more and more companies saying, well look I know we said we weren’t going to go and rent co-locations space again and put in servers and run our own cloud. But we should really run the numbers and figure out what they would look like’</p><p><strong>CloudStack in 3 words</strong></p><p>‘It just works’</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/cloudstack-advisory-on-spring4shell-cve">CloudStack Advisory on Spring4Shell (CVE-2022-22965&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;CVE-2022-22963)</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-04-14T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">April 14, 2022</time></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>At the beginning of April 2022, vulnerabilities in the Spring Framework for Java were publicly revealed.
