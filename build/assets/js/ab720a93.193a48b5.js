Conversely, we may decide during the development cycle, as a community, to accept a non-backwards compatible change which would bump the version to 5.0.0.  As such, it is difficult to know in advance what the proper semantic version number will be at when the work is released.  We run the risk of confusing our users if we start calling a pending release say 4.3.0, and accept a change mid-cycle that will bump it to 5.0.0.  To address this potential issue, I proposed that we refer to releases by a codename until feature freeze when we understand the complete scope of change and can apply the correct semantic version number.
